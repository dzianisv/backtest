# Session Summary

## Goal
Run the `research-market` workflow for AAPL (Apple Inc) end-to-end: Intake → Gather → Consolidate → Panel → Decide → Ledger, producing a portfolio-aware buy/sell/hold verdict.

## Constraints & Preferences
- No portfolio was provided by the user — chair must NOT assume/invent holdings; answer at market/asset level with general sizing/risk discipline only
- Workflow model: `claude-sonnet-4`
- Skills live at `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/.agents/skills/`
- Ledger script: `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/.agents/skills/forecast-ledger/ledger.py`
- No workflow plugin detected — orchestrating phases manually via subagent tasks

## Progress
### Done
- [x] Phase 0 Intake: research-manager discovered skills, produced structured plan for AAPL equity research
- [x] Phase 1 Gather (6 of 8 data seats complete + 0 of 3 feeds):
  - **fundamental-analysis**: AAPL $297.68, mkt cap $4.37T, trailing P/E 36.04, fwd P/E 31.02, P/B 41.0, EV/EBITDA 27.57, rev growth 6.43% YoY (16.6% QoQ), earnings growth 21.8%, gross margin 47.9%, op margin 32.3%, net margin 27.2%, FCF $101.1B (yield 2.31%), div yield 0.35%, debt/equity 79.55, PEG 2.42, beta 1.086
  - **regime-detection**: RISK_ON — SPY +8.9% above 200d MA, VIX 16.83 in contango (0.85 ratio), yield curve positive +79bp, breadth marginally improving, composite score +0.75 → 1.0x exposure
  - **trend-following**: AAPL $297.76, +11.19% above 200d MA ($267.79), bullish MA alignment (50d>200d), but near-term softening: RSI 38.83, MACD bearish crossover (histogram -2.06), -5.53% from 52w high ($315.20), 12m return +52.07%
  - **hedge-fund-13f-analysis**: 65.83% institutional ownership, Berkshire flat at 227.9M shares (21.99% of BRK portfolio) after ~65% trim through 2024, Morgan Stanley added 6.07%, superinvestor weighted avg hold price $253.79
  - **fomc-monitor**: Fed funds 3.50-3.75% (held 12-0), 10Y yield 4.451%, 2Y 3.856%, 10Y-2Y spread +0.595%, CPI +4.2% YoY (headline), core CPI +2.9%, DXY 100.88 (6mo high), next FOMC July 28-29
  - **dip-screener**: NOT in dip territory — only -6.2% from 52w high/ATH ($317.40), +11.2% above 200d MA; had -22.7% drawdown 3 months ago but largely recovered

### In Progress
- [ ] Phase 1 Gather: remaining 2 data seats (`analyst-derivatives-positioning`, `prediction-market-odds`) + 3 news feeds (`feed-wsj`, `feed-ft`, `feed-bloomberg`)

### Blocked
- (none)

## Key Decisions
- **Manual orchestration**: No workflow plugin available, so phases dispatched via subagent `task` calls
- **Parallel gather**: All data seats dispatched simultaneously for speed
- **Plan roster**: 8 gather skills, 3 feeds, 6 panel lenses (Buffett, Graham, Druckenmiller, Lacy Hunt/dissent, systematic trading, TA), guardrail (Morgan Housel), desk=`stock-research-desk`, chair=`stock-chair`

## Next Steps
1. Dispatch remaining 2 gather seats: `analyst-derivatives-positioning`, `prediction-market-odds`
2. Dispatch 3 news feeds: `feed-wsj`, `feed-ft`, `feed-bloomberg`
3. Phase 2: Consolidate — run `stock-research-desk` skill with all gather outputs merged into one brief
4. Phase 3: Panel — dispatch 6 analyst lenses in parallel + `analytics-morgan-housel` guardrail (non-voting)
5. Phase 4: Decide — run `stock-chair` with panel votes + desk brief; chair framing: "buy/hold/avoid verdict weighing ecosystem moat and services growth against rich mega-cap valuation and AI-bubble concentration risk"
6. Phase 5: Ledger — run `ledger.py` to log the dated chair call for AAPL

## Critical Context
- **Intake focus statement**: "AAPL hinges on: (1) Is premium valuation justified by durable moat and services margin expansion? (2) Buffett trimmed ~65% — is smart money signaling peak quality-at-a-price? (3) Does macro (rate path, AI-concentration risk, China/tariff exposure) create asymmetric downside?"
- **asset_class**: equity | **side**: buy | **horizon**: medium-term 6-18 months
- **portfolio_provided**: false — chair must use general sizing/risk discipline only
- **REPORT_DATE**: 2026-06-18
