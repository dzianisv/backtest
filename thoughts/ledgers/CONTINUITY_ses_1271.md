# Session Summary

## Goal
Complete a codebase consolidation that merges the duplicate `skills/` directory into `.agents/skills/`, fixes all stale path references across docs, and commits with detailed recoverable messages.

## Constraints & Preferences
- Only change bare `skills/` paths, NOT `.agents/skills/` (already correct)
- Openclaw runtime paths (`~/.openclaw/workspace/investor/skills/`) are NOT repo paths — leave as-is
- Historical prose references in `research/07-reading-list.md`, `evals/crypto/RESULTS.md`, `thoughts/ledgers/` are cosmetic — not worth fixing
- Commit messages must be detailed enough to recover full context without reading diffs
- No runtime changes — only documentation and deprecation banners

## Progress
### Done
- [x] **Commit `5ff2fd0`** — tier 1: copied 7 unique skills from `skills/` → `.agents/skills/`, archived 3 dead backtests to `backtests/archive/`, relocated eval tests to `evals/hf/`, updated pre-push hook
- [x] **Commit `8b99049`** — tier 2: deleted `skills/` from git, fixed path refs in 10+ docs, deprecation banners on `liveness-monitor` + `agentic-fund-orchestration`, deduplicated `fedwatch_zq.py`, AGENTS.md single-root framing
- [x] Verification review: all 18 skills present in `.agents/skills/`, archived backtests intact (13-15KB each), eval tests present, pre-push passes, deprecation banners correct (both YAML `deprecated: true` + visible blockquote)
- [x] Fixed 3 remaining stale refs found during review:
  - `research/09-stock-selection-evidence.md` line 111: `skills/fundamental-analysis` → `.agents/skills/fundamental-analysis`
  - `strategy/v3-bubble-aware-all-weather.md` line 132: `[../skills/](../skills/README.md)` → `[.agents/skills/](../.agents/skills/README.md)`
  - `strategy/v3-bubble-aware-all-weather.md` line 168: `skills/` → `.agents/skills/`

### In Progress
- [ ] Stage the 3 new fixes and commit (tier 2b follow-up)

### Blocked
- (none)

## Key Decisions
- **Leave openclaw pod paths alone**: `docs/tdd.md` lines 203/208 reference runtime paths on the openclaw deployment pod, not repo-relative paths
- **Leave historical prose refs**: `research/07-reading-list.md:49`, `evals/crypto/RESULTS.md:35`, `thoughts/ledgers/*` are logs/prose not navigation links
- **fedwatch_zq.py canonical in fomc-monitor**: prediction-market-odds copy replaced with 2-line pointer comment
- **Deprecation = YAML flag + visible blockquote**: both mechanisms used for liveness-monitor and agentic-fund-orchestration

## Next Steps
1. `git add research/09-stock-selection-evidence.md strategy/v3-bubble-aware-all-weather.md`
2. Commit with message like `chore: fix 3 remaining stale skills/ path refs (tier 2b)`
3. Run `bash hooks/pre-push` to confirm pass
4. Optionally clean up unstaged temp files (`report.md`, `status.md`) that are in worktree but untracked

## Critical Context
- Remaining known cosmetic stale refs (intentionally left): `docs/tdd.md:203,208` (openclaw runtime), `evals/crypto/RESULTS.md:35`, `research/07-reading-list.md:49`, `thoughts/ledgers/CONTINUITY_ses_12b8.md:53`
- Pre-push hook command: `bash hooks/pre-push` — checks hedge-fund invariant tests
- Git history: `8b99049 → 5ff2fd0 → 0a05b6a → cfdb382 → 6bd8409`
- Unstaged artifacts in worktree (NOT committed, intentional): `report.md`, `status.md`, `.agents/knowledgebase/claude-code-workflows.md`, `.agents/workflows/*.workflow.js`, `thoughts/ledgers/CONTINUITY_*`
