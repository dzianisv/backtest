# Session Summary

## Goal
Complete tier-2 skills consolidation cleanup: fix remaining bare `skills/` path references, add deprecation blockquotes, deduplicate `fedwatch_zq.py`, then commit all changes (prior agent's + ours) with a specified commit message.

## Constraints & Preferences
- Do NOT redo edits already applied by prior agent (strategy/README.md, research/05-*, 08-*, 09-*, docs/trend-stock-research.tdd.md, YAML frontmatter deprecation flags)
- Commit message must be used VERBATIM (multi-line, specific format provided in task)
- Deprecation blockquotes must be FIRST line after closing `---` with a blank line before existing content
- Only change bare `skills/` references (not already-correct `.agents/skills/` ones)

## Progress
### Done
- [x] Fixed `research/skills-grounding/stocks-grounding.md` — updated ~14 bare `skills/` refs to `.agents/skills/` (table rows lines 12-16, section headers 2.1-2.9)
- [x] Fixed `research/skills-grounding/crypto-grounding.md` — updated 3 bare `skills/` refs (dip-tranches-strategy link, risk-management/trend-following links, P13 trend-following inline reference)
- [x] Added deprecation blockquote to `.agents/skills/liveness-monitor/SKILL.md` after `---` closing frontmatter
- [x] Added deprecation blockquote to `.agents/skills/agentic-fund-orchestration/SKILL.md` after `---` closing frontmatter
- [x] Verified `fedwatch_zq.py` copies are identical (diff returned empty)
- [x] Replaced `.agents/skills/prediction-market-odds/fedwatch_zq.py` with 2-line pointer comment

### In Progress
- [ ] `git add -A && git status` — stage everything
- [ ] Commit with verbatim message
- [ ] Run `bash hooks/pre-push` to verify
- [ ] Run `git log --oneline -5` and report

### Blocked
(none)

## Key Decisions
- **Updated all bare `skills/` refs in grounding docs**: These are section headers and table cells referencing skills by path; updating to `.agents/skills/` keeps them consistent with the canonical location post-consolidation.
- **Used `write` for fedwatch pointer**: Since the file content is being fully replaced with a 2-line pointer, a full write was simpler than an edit.

## Next Steps
1. Run `git add -A` then `git status` to see full staged changeset
2. Commit with the exact multi-line message from the task spec (starts with `chore: complete skills consolidation (tier 2 cleanup)`)
3. Run `bash hooks/pre-push` to validate
4. Run `git log --oneline -5` to confirm
5. Report: what was changed, what was already correct, final git log

## Critical Context
- Prior agent commit `5ff2fd0` handled high-risk items (unique skill copy, eval test relocation, hook update)
- The commit message is provided verbatim in the task and MUST be copied exactly including newlines
- The `hooks/pre-push` script exists and should be run for verification
- All 5 file modifications are complete; only git operations remain

## File Operations
### Read
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/research/skills-grounding/stocks-grounding.md` (lines 10-21, 55-64, 93+)
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/research/skills-grounding/crypto-grounding.md`
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/.agents/skills/liveness-monitor/SKILL.md`
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/.agents/skills/agentic-fund-orchestration/SKILL.md`

### Modified
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/research/skills-grounding/stocks-grounding.md` — 10 edits (table + section headers)
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/research/skills-grounding/crypto-grounding.md` — 3 edits (links + inline ref)
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/.agents/skills/liveness-monitor/SKILL.md` — inserted deprecation blockquote
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/.agents/skills/agentic-fund-orchestration/SKILL.md` — inserted deprecation blockquote
- `/Users/engineer/workspace/backtest/.agents/skills/prediction-market-odds/fedwatch_zq.py` — replaced with 2-line pointer

### Shell Commands Run
- `diff .agents/skills/fomc-monitor/fedwatch_zq.py .agents/skills/prediction-market-odds/fedwatch_zq.py` → empty (identical)
- `grep` for `\bskills/[^.]` in `research/skills-grounding/` → found 18 matches (all now fixed)
