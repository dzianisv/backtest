# Knowledgebase — Investing in a Possible AI Bubble

A research library built to answer one question:

> **"I have $1M in cash. The market looks like an AI bubble (à la dot-com). How
> do I deploy it so I participate in upside but survive a crash — and how do I
> automate that with an agentic team?"**

Everything here is **educational analysis, not financial advice.** Numbers come
from cited public sources (May 2026) and from our own backtests in this repo.

## TL;DR of the whole library

1. **The valuation case for caution is real.** Shiller CAPE ~41.6 (2nd-highest
   in 144 years, vs 44 at the 2000 peak); Buffett indicator ~220-235% (*worse*
   than 2000's ~140%); top-10 stocks ≈40% of the S&P (vs ~27% in 2000). GMO,
   Vanguard and Goldman all forecast below-average 10-yr US equity returns.
2. **But it is *not* a carbon copy of 2000.** Today's leaders (NVIDIA et al.)
   have real, huge earnings; the valuation *premium* of the top-10 over the rest
   is half what it was in 2000. The swing factor is whether ~$500B/yr of AI capex
   earns a return — genuinely unresolved.
3. **The base-rate risk is severe enough to plan around.** In 2000-2002 the
   Nasdaq fell ~78% and took ~15 years to recover; the S&P fell ~49%. Our
   backtest reproduces this: 2000-2009 was a "lost decade" — S&P −0.9%/yr, QQQ
   −6.8%/yr — while diversified all-weather portfolios compounded at +7-10%/yr.
4. **You don't have to predict the crash to be protected.** Mechanical,
   rules-based diversification (permanent portfolio, golden butterfly, all-weather)
   and trend-following ("crisis alpha") cut max drawdowns from ~−55% to ~−15%
   *without* requiring a market call — at a cost of some bull-market upside.
5. **It can be automated and governed** by a small team of specialized agents
   (regime analyst, portfolio manager, risk manager with a deterministic veto,
   execution) — paper-traded first, with hard caps enforced in code outside the LLM.
