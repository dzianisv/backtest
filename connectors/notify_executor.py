"""
Notification-first executor — the connector that satisfies GOAL tracks D & E in
**paper / notification mode** without any live credentials.

Operating modes (GOAL invariant #2: notification-first / human-in-the-loop):
  - "notify"  (DEFAULT): validate against hard caps, append to the immutable audit log, and EMIT
                the order ticket for a human to place/approve. NEVER contacts a broker. No creds needed.
  - "paper" : same, but routes to a TESTNET venue when available (Coinbase CDP base-sepolia faucet).
                Still no mainnet funds. (Hook point — real testnet call is wired when creds present.)
  - "live"  : routes to the real venue. HARD-GATED — refuses unless ALL of:
                (a) env creds present for the venue,
                (b) CONFIRM_LIVE=<today's date> env matches,
                (c) order.strategy_ref names a backtest that PASSed the gate,
                (d) caps pass.
              Live wiring is intentionally a stub here (raises) so this module can never place a
              real order by accident; the documented path to enable it is in the connector skills.

Venues: "robinhood" (MCP: agent.robinhood.com/mcp/trading) and "coinbase-cdp" (npx @coinbase/cdp-cli,
also an MCP server). In notify mode we don't call them — we describe the exact call the human/agent
would approve.

Educational analysis, not financial advice. The agent proposes; a human disposes.
