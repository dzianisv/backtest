# Bubble-Aware All-Weather — deploy $1M with crash protection

A research + backtest lab answering one question:

> **"I have $1M in cash. The market looks like an AI bubble (à la dot-com). How do I deploy it so I
> participate in upside but survive a crash — and automate that with an agentic team?"**

> ⚠️ **Educational analysis only — not financial advice.** Past backtest performance does not guarantee
> future results. Validate with a fee-only fiduciary before deploying real capital.

## What this project is

Two missions, one north-star ([`GOAL.md`](GOAL.md)):

1. **The agentic hedge-fund** (core). An automated, recommend-only team that runs the loop
   **discover → backtest → human-approve → execute → report** over a **$1M tradfi book** + a separate
   **~$177k crypto book**, AI-bubble-defended, behind a hard backtest-before-trade gate. The agent
   proposes; the human approves every order.

2. **AI Agent Investment Advisor** (new sub-project). A **proactive, notification-first** advisor that
   watches markets *daily* and DMs the owner the moment a quality, time-sensitive setup appears —
   catching the next Google −30% / SanDisk / BTC-dip the owner keeps missing for lack of research time.
   It is **not a new runtime**: it's a portable skill+config layer deployed onto existing agentic
   systems (**openclaw, hermes-ai, claude-code**) using their **native primitives** — openclaw
   `heartbeat` + `HEARTBEAT.md`, claude-code `/loop` + `/goal` + dynamic workflows + Routines, the
   hermes scheduler. Same skills on all three; only the scheduling/notification wiring differs.
   **Recommend-only** — it never places a trade.

   |---|---|
   | [`docs/GOAL.md`](docs/GOAL.md) | the advisor north-star (the missed-opportunity mandate) |
   | [`docs/prd.md`](docs/prd.md) | **what** — gaps → features, cadence, personas |
   | [`docs/tdd.md`](docs/tdd.md) | **how** — architecture + full wiring diagrams + data contracts |
   | [`.agents/setup/`](.agents/setup/) | per-backend proactive deployment (openclaw / claude-code / hermes) |

   Status: skills built, tested, and documented; not yet validated live on a backend.

## The answer in three lines

1. **Don't bet the whole $1M on cap-weight S&P/QQQ at CAPE ~41.** In our 2000-2026 backtest the S&P fell −55% and QQQ −83%; 2000-2009 was a lost decade.
2. **Selection isn't the edge.** Bottom-up stock-picking (incl. Morningstar's MOAT) doesn't reliably beat a cheap index (our backtests + SPIVA).
3. **The edge is structural.** De-concentrated diversification + a trend/regime overlay (crisis alpha) + risk management + a dip-reserve, run by an agentic team — caps the left tail without a market call. → [`strategy/v3`](strategy/v3-bubble-aware-all-weather.md).
