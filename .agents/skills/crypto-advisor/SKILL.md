# Crypto Advisor

Loop through the token universe **one token at a time** (TradingView has a single chart slot — CIO holds it per token) → run Phase 1 Research Desk in parallel (5 researchers) → CIO consolidates briefing → run Phase 2 Investment Panel in parallel (6 investors) → conviction-weighted synthesis → Verdict Critic → Citation Validator → print the report.

> Educational analysis, not financial advice. No leverage. Ever.

## Architecture

**Three-layer hedge-fund pipeline.** Research Desk gathers data; CIO consolidates into a briefing package; Investment Panel reads the briefing and votes.

**Layer 1 — Research Desk** (data gatherers, no votes):
- `analyse-technical` → TradingView MCP — OHLCV, RSI, BB, MACD, MAs
- `analyse-onchain` → MVRV-Z, realized price, NUPL, Puell, LTH/STH supply, exchange flows
- `analyse-defi` → DeFiLlama: TVL, fee distribution, protocol accrual
- `analyse-macro` → GLI, M2, DXY, ETF flows, halving cycle, macro headlines
- `analyse-smartmoney` → Whale flows, exchange inflows/outflows, OTC desk, positioning

**Layer 2 — CIO** consolidates → one briefing package per token

**Layer 3 — Investment Panel** (read briefing, vote per school):
- `investor-benjamin-graham` → Value school (Graham/Klarman)
- `investor-warren-buffett` → Quality school (Buffett/Fisher)
- `investor-ray-dalio` → Cycle school (Dalio/Templeton)
- `investor-stanley-druckenmiller` → Trend school (Druckenmiller/Carver)
- `investor-lyn-alden` → Debasement school (fiscal dominance, scarce-asset, BTC-as-hurdle)
- `analyse-defi` → On-chain school (Burniske) — dual role: research + vote

**Why tokens loop sequentially:** TradingView has a single chart slot (`chart_set_symbol` is a global mutation). CIO pulls TV data for one token at a time. The Research Desk and Investment Panel for a given token each run in parallel within their phase, but the per-token pipeline is strictly sequential.


## Quickstart

### Default daily run
```
Run the crypto advisor
```
Analyzes the default universe, pulls live TradingView data, runs Phase 1 Research Desk + Phase 2 Investment Panel per token, prints the 3-block report (signal table + plain-English verdicts + ranked news). **Attach a TradingView screenshot for each token.**

### Custom token set
```
Run the crypto advisor on: TON, JUP, HYPE
```

### Full prompt (copy-paste for any session)
```
Invoke the crypto-advisor skill. Token universe for this run: [TOKEN1, TOKEN2, ...].
Follow all skill instructions:
- chart_get_state → dedup indicators → set_symbol → D OHLCV (365 summary + 210 bars) → study values → W OHLCV → capture_screenshot
- Compute MAs via .agents/skills/crypto-advisor/scripts/indicators.py
- Phase 1: Run 5 research subagents in parallel (technical/onchain/defi/macro/smartmoney) — data only, no votes
- CIO consolidates 5 briefs into one briefing package per token
- Phase 2: Run 6 investor subagents in parallel — each reads full briefing, votes from school lens with a conviction rating
- Narrative seat: web-fetch ≥3 sources, rank T1/T2/T3, quote exact sentences
- Print 3-block report: signal table | plain-English verdicts | news sources
- Attach TradingView screenshot for each token in the reply
Educational, not financial advice.
```

### Scheduling (continuous)
```
/loop interval=6h    ← re-runs every 6 hours, resumes from last pending todo
/stop                ← cancel the loop
```

## Token universe

**STALENESS RULE — every row:** Any tokenomics claim (fee switch, buyback, burn, staking yield, revenue accrual, governance status) is a live fact that changes via governance vote. Verify it with a live `web_fetch` before using it in any verdict or add/remove decision — never from memory. Full verification procedure: §Research Desk Phase 1 (Step 1b).

| Token | Rationale | TradingView symbol |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| BTC   | Foundational monetary layer; largest market cap | `BINANCE:BTCUSDT` |
| ETH   | Smart-contract platform; stablecoin infra (53% of $300B market) | `BINANCE:ETHUSDT` |
| SOL   | High-performance L1; Solana DeFi base layer | `BINANCE:SOLUSDT` |
| TON   | Telegram L1; 900M-user payment infra (Wallet + USDT); watch Durov legal status | `BINANCE:TONUSDT` |
| HYPE  | Hyperliquid perp DEX; 97% revenue auto-buyback hardcoded; real cashflow token | `OKX:HYPEUSDT` |
| AAVE  | Leading DeFi lending protocol; real yield from spreads + GHO fees; >$1T cumulative loans | `BINANCE:AAVEUSDT` |
| JUP   | Jupiter — Solana DeFi super-app (perps, lending, launchpad, DCA, staking); 15+ fee streams | `BINANCE:JUPUSDT` |
| UNI   | Uniswap — fee switch activated Dec 2025 (UNIfication, 99.9% vote); trading fees → burn UNI via Firepit; $1B+/yr fee base; expanding to all v3 + 8 chains | `BINANCE:UNIUSDT` |
| AERO  | Aerodrome Finance — Base chain DEX; real trading fees; ve(3,3) tokenomics with revenue accrual | `BINANCE:AEROUSDT` |
| PUMP  | Pump.fun — Solana meme launchpad; reflexive fees; track for cycle timing signal | `OKX:PUMPUSDT` |
| LINK  | Oracle network; backbone of RWA tokenization (Swift, Euroclear, JPMorgan, UBS) | `BINANCE:LINKUSDT` |

## Hard constraints — read before running (these dictate the whole design)

1. **TradingView MCP tools live ONLY in the orchestrator (you).** Subagents get a fresh toolset with **no** `tradingview-*` tools, so YOU pull every chart datum. Never tell a subagent to "pull TradingView data" — it cannot. The `analyse-technical` subagent *receives* the pre-assembled TV data package from CIO and formats the technical brief from it (no MCP access of its own). All other research subagents fetch their own data sources via `web_fetch`.
2. **The chart is a single shared symbol slot.** `chart_set_symbol` mutates the one global chart — two tokens cannot be pulled at once. **The per-token data loop is strictly sequential, one token at a time.** Track progress in `todos` so a `/loop` or interrupted run resumes cleanly.
3. **Read every indicator from TradingView — don't recompute it.** `data_get_study_values` returns RSI(14), Bollinger(20,2), MACD(12,26,9), Volume at standard lengths — use them verbatim. The only gap is moving averages: `chart_manage_indicator` ignores the MA `length` input and has no `update` action. So EMA20 / SMA50 / SMA200 / 200-week-MA — and only those — are computed by `scripts/indicators.py` from the MCP's **own** returned closes (the data source stays 100% TradingView).

TradingView symbol mapping: `BINANCE:{TOKEN}USDT`. If a symbol is missing on Binance, try `OKX:{TOKEN}USDT`.

---

## Step 0 — Seed the todo list (one row per token)

Each todo covers the full 2-phase pipeline: Phase 1 Research Desk → CIO consolidation → Phase 2 Investment Panel → quorum verdict.

```sql
INSERT INTO todos (id, title, description) VALUES
 ('tok-BTC', 'Analyzing BTC',  'Phase 1: pull TV data → 5 research briefs → briefing package. Phase 2: 6 investor votes → conviction-weighted synthesis → signal'),
 ('tok-ETH', 'Analyzing ETH',  'idem'),
 ('tok-SOL', 'Analyzing SOL',  'idem'),
 ('tok-TON', 'Analyzing TON',  'idem — watch Durov legal proceedings'),
 ('tok-HYPE','Analyzing HYPE', 'idem — use OKX:HYPEUSDT'),
 ('tok-AAVE','Analyzing AAVE', 'idem'),
 ('tok-JUP', 'Analyzing JUP',  'idem — Jupiter Solana DeFi super-app'),
 ('tok-UNI', 'Analyzing UNI',  'idem — fee switch live Dec 2025; burns via Firepit; $1B+/yr fee base'),
 ('tok-AERO','Analyzing AERO', 'idem — Aerodrome Finance Base DEX, try BINANCE:AEROUSDT'),
 ('tok-PUMP','Analyzing PUMP', 'idem — pump.fun token, try OKX:PUMPUSDT'),
 ('tok-LINK','Analyzing LINK', 'idem');
```

Create the verdict tracker once:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS token_analysis (
  symbol TEXT PRIMARY KEY, quorum_verdict TEXT, dominant_zone TEXT,
  seats_bull INTEGER, seats_bear INTEGER, key_support REAL, key_resistance REAL,
  confidence TEXT, signal TEXT, status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending');
```

---

## Step 0.5 — Create the run artifact directory

Run once before the per-token loop. Every token gets its own subdirectory `$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/`.

```bash
RUN_DIR=".cache/crypto-advisor/research/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M)"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"
echo "Artifacts: $RUN_DIR"
```

Fetch Lyn Alden's current macro context **once per run** — her views are book-wide (token-agnostic) and Phase 2 investor seats cannot fetch; data must arrive pre-loaded in the briefing package:

```bash
# Lyn current-views — token-agnostic macro signal; fetch once, inject into every briefing
bun .agents/skills/investor-lyn-alden/scripts/current_context.ts --days 30 > "$RUN_DIR/lyn_current_context.md" 2>&1
echo "Lyn context: $RUN_DIR/lyn_current_context.md — degrades to [UNAVAILABLE] lines per source if offline; proceed regardless"
```

---

## Step 1 — Sequential per-token analysis

Pick the next `pending` todo, `UPDATE todos SET status='in_progress'`, then for that token:

> **Why sequential:** TradingView has a single shared chart slot. CIO must pull TV data before spawning Phase 1 subagents (the `analyse-technical` brief depends on it). Only one token can occupy the chart at a time. Within each phase, all subagents for the current token run in parallel.

### 1a. CIO pulls TradingView data (orchestrator-only, sequential)

CIO executes the full TradingView data pull for this token **before** spawning any subagents. This produces the data package for `analyse-technical`.

```
chart_get_state → dedup indicators → chart_set_symbol(BINANCE:{TOKEN}USDT) →
data_get_ohlcv(D, summary=true, bars=210) → data_get_study_values(RSI, BB, MACD, Volume) →
chart_set_timeframe(W) → data_get_ohlcv(W, summary=true, bars=100) →
chart_set_timeframe(D) → capture_screenshot
```

Compute moving averages using `scripts/indicators.py` from the returned closes (EMA20, SMA50, SMA200, 200wMA).

Package into `tv_data_package`:
```json
{
  "token": "BTC",
  "price_usd": 67500,
  "daily": { "ohlcv_summary": {}, "bars": [] },
  "weekly": { "ohlcv_summary": {} },
  "indicators": { "rsi": 42.6, "macd_hist": -120, "bb_upper": 72000, "bb_lower": 61000 },
  "moving_averages": { "ema20": 68200, "sma50": 70100, "sma200": 65400, "ma200w": 62000 },
  "screenshot_path": ".cache/crypto-advisor/research/{RUN_DIR}/{TOKEN}/chart.png"
}
```

```bash
echo '{tv_data_package_json}' > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/tv_data_package.json"
```

### 1b. Phase 1 — Research Desk (parallel, 5 researchers)

Spawn all five research subagents in parallel. Each returns a structured brief (data only — **no vote**):

| Researcher | Skill | Data source |
|---|---|---|
| `analyse-technical` | `analyse-technical` | Receives `tv_data_package` from CIO — formats technical brief from pre-pulled data; no MCP access |
| `analyse-onchain` | `analyse-onchain` | Fetches MVRV-Z, realized price, NUPL, Puell multiple from glassnode / lookintobitcoin / cryptoquant |
| `analyse-defi` | `analyse-defi` | Fetches DeFiLlama: TVL, fee distribution, protocol revenue accrual |
| `analyse-macro` | `analyse-macro` | Fetches GLI/M2/DXY, ETF flows, halving cycle context, macro headlines |
| `analyse-smartmoney` | `analyse-smartmoney` | Fetches exchange inflows/outflows, whale wallet movements, OTC desk data, positioning |

Pass to each researcher: `{ token: "{TOKEN}", price_usd: {PRICE}, tv_data_package: <json> }`. Only `analyse-technical` uses `tv_data_package`; the others fetch their own data sources.

**Researcher brief format** (returned by each, no vote):
```
{RESEARCHER} — {TOKEN}
Sources fetched:
  [T1] https://<url-fetched> — "<verbatim quote>" → T1 because: <one sentence>
  [T2] https://<url-fetched> — "<verbatim quote>" → T2 because: <one sentence>
  [FETCH FAILED: https://...] — not counted
Brief:
  <3–5 bullet points of what was found, with hard numbers>
  <Data only — no vote, no recommendation>
Invalidation anchor: <what data change would flip this picture>
```

Technical researcher brief format (no fetching — receives TV package from CIO):
```
analyse-technical — {TOKEN}
Data source: TradingView MCP (pre-pulled by CIO)
Brief:
  - Price: ${price_usd} | EMA20: {x} | SMA50: {x} | SMA200: {x} | 200wMA: {x}
  - Death cross: {bool} | Golden cross: {bool}
  - RSI(14): {x} | MACD hist: {x} | BB upper/lower: {x}/{x}
  - Daily OHLCV summary: {ohlcv_summary}
  - Weekly trend: {weekly_summary}
```

**Sourcing rules for research subagents:**

**HARD RULE: call `web_fetch` on a real URL before citing it — OR cite a record from a feed script (`feeds/wsj.ts`/`feeds/ft.ts`/`read_news.ts`), which return real URLs + verbatim publisher teasers. A URL neither web_fetched nor returned by a feed script this run is NOT a source. A headline with no URL is a hallucination and invalidates the entire brief.**

> **Known broken sources (never use):**
> - `coindesk.com/search?q=...` — returns the same unrelated featured article regardless of query.
> - `decrypt.co/tag/...` — 404 for most tokens.
> - `cryptopanic.com/news/...` — returns only the page title, no articles.
> Use the **two-step pattern**: (1) fetch a listing page for current article URLs, (2) fetch the article URL for the quote.

**`web_fetch` ≥3 of these starting URLs** per token (applies to `analyse-macro`, `analyse-smartmoney`, and `analyse-defi` where applicable):

**On-chain data (T1 — try first):**
- Fear & Greed: `https://api.alternative.me/fng/?limit=1` (JSON)
- DeFiLlama chain: `https://defillama.com/chain/ethereum` | `.../solana` etc. (TVL, fees, revenue)
- DeFiLlama protocol: `https://defillama.com/protocol/{slug}` e.g. `aave`, `uniswap`, `chainlink`

**News discovery — two-step (T2):**
- Step 1: fetch a **listing page** for current URLs: `https://www.coindesk.com/markets` (BTC/ETH/macro) · `https://www.coindesk.com/tech` (DeFi/protocol) · `https://www.theblock.co/latest` (broad).
- Step 2: extract a token-relevant article URL from the listing, fetch it, quote its body. Cite the article URL, not the listing.

**Macro context — FT/WSJ via feed scripts (T2, for BTC/ETH & risk regime):** FT/WSJ listing pages are paywalled/bot-blocked — do NOT web_fetch them. Run the feed scripts; each prints real `wsj.com`/`ft.com` URLs + a verbatim 1-sentence teaser + date (the teaser IS a citable T2 quote). `--query` is AND-of-words — use ONE topic word (e.g. `bitcoin`, `Fed`, `crypto`) or omit it:
```bash
bun .agents/skills/read-news/scripts/feeds/wsj.ts --feed markets --days 5 --limit 20 --text
bun .agents/skills/read-news/scripts/feeds/ft.ts  --section markets,global-economy --query bitcoin --days 5 --text
```
For a consolidated crypto+macro feed (deduped across outlets) use [[narrative-news]]:
`bun .agents/skills/read-news/scripts/read_news.ts --db .cache/read-news/news.db --days 5 --query "<token/theme>"`.

On error or no relevant content, write `[FETCH FAILED: <url>]` — do not count it toward the 3-source minimum, do not invent what it "would have said."

**Quote verbatim** — copy an exact sentence or number; never paraphrase from memory.

**DeFiLlama QUOTE RULE:** DeFiLlama pages are metric dashboards — the quote must be a literal copy of the numbers shown. Accepted:
  - `"Protocol Revenue (24h): $X | Annual: $X | TVL: $X"`
  - `"Fees (30d): $X | Revenue (30d): $X"`
  - `"Chain Revenue (24h)$65,225... App Revenue (24h)$1.1m"`

A descriptive summary ("protocol revenue confirmed", "GHO expansion ongoing") is a paraphrase and **FAILS** this check. If no quotable metric string exists, write `[FETCH FAILED: no parseable metric found]`.

**On-chain seat — tokenomics live check (DeFi tokens).** For any non-L1 token (not BTC/ETH/SOL/TON), `analyse-defi` must verify protocol mechanics via live fetch before writing the DeFi brief. **NEVER state a tokenomics claim (fee switch, buyback, burn, staking yield, revenue accrual) from memory — governance votes change protocol economics at any time.**

1. `web_fetch https://defillama.com/protocol/{slug}` — check the **Protocol Revenue** row and the description for burns, buybacks, revenue distribution.
2. If DeFiLlama shows non-zero revenue AND recall says "no accrual" → **you are stale**. Fetch the governance forum: `web_fetch https://www.theblock.co/search?query={TOKEN}+fee+switch` and `web_fetch https://gov.uniswap.org`.
3. Characterize mechanics only after the live fetch. Quote the source verbatim; cite the URL.

**Rank sources by signal quality:**
- **Tier 1 — Primary signal:** on-chain/flow data with timestamps and hard numbers (ETF flow $, protocol revenue $, F&G value). Weight 3×. Drives posture.
- **Tier 2 — Credible context:** Bloomberg/Reuters/FT/WSJ/CoinDesk/TheBlock with named sources and specific claims. Weight 2×. Supports posture.
- **Tier 3 — Noise/sentiment gauge:** social media, "analysts say", recycled press releases. Weight 0.5×. Sentiment only, never drives posture.

**Show the ranking reason** per source (one sentence, e.g. "T1: F&G returned value=18 with timestamp — hard data point").

**Fewer than 2 successfully fetched sources after trying all applicable URLs → mark the brief "INSUFFICIENT DATA" and note the gap. Do not guess.**

**Cache each researcher brief:**
```bash
echo '{tech_brief_json}'    > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/brief_technical.json"
echo '{onchain_brief_json}' > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/brief_onchain.json"
echo '{defi_brief_json}'    > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/brief_defi.json"
echo '{macro_brief_json}'   > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/brief_macro.json"
echo '{sm_brief_json}'      > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/brief_smartmoney.json"
```

### 1c. CIO consolidates into briefing package

After all 5 research briefs return, CIO merges them into one structured markdown document:

```markdown
## BRIEFING PACKAGE — {TOKEN} @ ${price_usd}

### Technical (TradingView)
{tech_brief content}

### On-Chain
{onchain_brief content}

### DeFi / Protocol
{defi_brief content}

### Macro
{macro_brief content}

### Smart Money
{smartmoney_brief content}

## Lyn Alden — current views (live, last 30d)
$(cat "$RUN_DIR/lyn_current_context.md")
```

```bash
echo "$BRIEFING_PACKAGE" > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/briefing_package.md"
```

### 1d. Phase 2 — Investment Panel (parallel, 6 investors)

Spawn all six investor subagents in parallel. Each reads the **full briefing package** and votes from their school's lens. **No additional data fetching** — data was gathered in Phase 1.

| Investor | Skill | School |
|---|---|---|
| `investor-benjamin-graham` | `investor-benjamin-graham` | Value — margin of safety, P/E equivalent, downside protection (Graham/Klarman) |
| `investor-warren-buffett` | `investor-warren-buffett` | Quality — moat, revenue quality, sustainable competitive advantage (Buffett/Fisher) |
| `investor-ray-dalio` | `investor-ray-dalio` | Cycle — macro regime, liquidity cycle, risk parity perspective (Dalio/Templeton) |
| `investor-stanley-druckenmiller` | `investor-stanley-druckenmiller` | Trend — price structure, momentum, entry/exit timing (Druckenmiller/Carver) |
| `investor-lyn-alden` | `investor-lyn-alden` | Debasement — fiscal dominance, currency debasement, scarce-asset / BTC-as-hurdle (Alden) |
| `analyse-defi` (Burniske) | `analyse-defi` | On-chain — fee capture, token velocity, protocol cash flows (Burniske lens) |

> **`analyse-defi` dual role:** In Phase 1, `analyse-defi` gathered DeFiLlama data (TVL/fees) and returned a data brief. In Phase 2, it reads the full briefing package and votes from Chris Burniske's on-chain value accrual lens — same skill, separate role.

> **Lyn Alden seat — live context:** The briefing package includes a **"Lyn Alden — current views (live, last 30d)"** section fetched from her X/Nostr/blog this run. The Lyn seat MUST weigh this live macro stance ON TOP OF the standing framework (*Broken Money*, fiscal dominance, BTC-as-hurdle). When her current read shifts or reinforces the vote, cite the specific dated post in the Reason field (e.g. `2026-06-21 X thread: "writing about the implications of the US/Iran MOU…"`). Filter the live feed: macro/monetary-policy signal counts; personal, fiction, or book-promotion posts do not.

Pass to each investor: `{ token: "{TOKEN}", price_usd: {PRICE}, briefing_package: "<full markdown>" }`.

**Investor vote format** (returned by each):
```
{INVESTOR} ({SCHOOL}) — {TOKEN}
Vote: BULLISH | NEUTRAL | BEARISH
Conviction: HIGH | MED | LOW   ← how strongly the briefing data supports THIS school's read for THIS token (not generic confidence)
Reason: <School>: <one-line citing briefing data — reference specific numbers from the brief>
Invalidation: <what would reverse this vote>
```

**Cache investor votes:**
```bash
echo '{graham_vote_json}'   > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/vote_graham.json"
echo '{buffett_vote_json}'  > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/vote_buffett.json"
echo '{dalio_vote_json}'    > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/vote_dalio.json"
echo '{druck_vote_json}'    > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/vote_druckenmiller.json"
echo '{alden_vote_json}'    > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/vote_alden.json"
echo '{burniske_vote_json}' > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/vote_burniske.json"
```

### 1e. Aggregate into the compact verdict and persist

Synthesize the 6 investor votes **by conviction, not headcount** (see quorum_verdict rules below):

```json
{"symbol":"BTC","quorum_verdict":"BULLISH|SPLIT|BEARISH|UNCERTAIN",
 "dominant_zone":"DEEP_VALUE|FAIR_VALUE|ELEVATED|EXTREME",
 "seats_bull":3,"seats_bear":2,"bull_weight":7,"bear_weight":4,"core_dissent":"<lens + one line, or none>",
 "key_support":60000,"key_resistance":66000,"confidence":"HIGH|MED|LOW"}
```

```sql
UPDATE token_analysis SET quorum_verdict=?, dominant_zone=?, seats_bull=?, seats_bear=?,
  key_support=?, key_resistance=?, confidence=?, signal=?, status='done' WHERE symbol=?;
UPDATE todos SET status='done' WHERE id='tok-{TOKEN}';
```

```bash
echo '{verdict_json}' > "$RUN_DIR/{TOKEN}/verdict.json"
```

### 1f. Repeat

Repeat Steps 1a–1e for the next `pending` todo until none remain.

**After all tokens complete — write the full report:**
```bash
echo "$FULL_REPORT_MARKDOWN" > "$RUN_DIR/report.md"
echo "Run artifacts: $RUN_DIR"
```

Directory layout after a complete run:
```

## quorum_verdict — conviction-weighted synthesis (CIO judgment, not headcount)

**Do not tally votes.** A static seat count is wrong because schools are not equally relevant to every
token: a single HIGH-conviction read from the lens that owns this token's main value driver outweighs three
LOW-conviction reads from lenses that barely touch it. Synthesize the six votes into `quorum_verdict` thus:

1. **Weight each vote by conviction.** HIGH = 3, MED = 2, LOW = 1. A NEUTRAL vote contributes 0 regardless
   of conviction (it is an abstention, not a half-vote).
2. **Identify the CORE lenses for THIS token** (the ones whose school owns its dominant value driver):
   - **DeFi protocol tokens** (AAVE, UNI, JUP, AERO, PUMP, HYPE, LINK) → Burniske (fee capture / value-accrual)
     and Graham (margin of safety on real cash flows) are CORE. Alden's BTC-as-hurdle test gates whether the
     token even clears the bar vs just holding BTC.
   - **L1 monetary assets** (BTC, ETH, SOL, TON) → Alden (debasement / scarce-asset), Dalio (macro cycle) and
     Druckenmiller (trend) are CORE; Burniske's DeFi-accrual lens is often N/A here — down-weight it.
   - Double the conviction weight of CORE lenses; halve the weight of lenses flagged N/A for this token.
3. **Compute the lean:** `bull_weight − bear_weight` after the CORE adjustment. Log both in the verdict JSON.
4. **Name the strongest CORE dissent** (`core_dissent`) and state explicitly why it is or is not outweighed.
   A **HIGH-conviction CORE dissent caps the verdict at SPLIT** unless it is directly rebutted with brief data —
   you may not bury the lens that owns the token's value driver under unrelated bullishness.
5. **Map to verdict:**
   - **BULLISH** — lean clearly positive AND no unrebutted HIGH-conviction CORE dissent.
   - **BEARISH** — lean clearly negative driven by CORE lenses.
   - **SPLIT** — CORE lenses genuinely conflict, or a HIGH CORE dissent stands unrebutted.
   - **UNCERTAIN** — key briefs are thin / `[UNAVAILABLE]`; do not manufacture a verdict.

Log `seats_bull` / `seats_bear` as raw audit counts, but they are **inputs to the reasoning above, not the
gate** — the verdict is the conviction-weighted judgment, and you must be able to defend it in one sentence.

---

## Step 2 — Decide per token

| Signal | Condition |
|---|---|
| **BUY** | `quorum_verdict = BULLISH`, `dominant_zone ∈ {DEEP_VALUE, FAIR_VALUE}`, `weekly_closes >= 200` |
| **BUY\*** | `quorum_verdict = BULLISH`, `dominant_zone = ELEVATED` → downgrade to **HOLD** + note "await pullback" |
| **BUY\*\*** | `quorum_verdict = BULLISH`, `dominant_zone = EXTREME` → downgrade to **HOLD** + note "extended, avoid" |
| **BUY (small)** | (`quorum_verdict = BULLISH`, `weekly_closes < 200`) OR (`quorum_verdict = SPLIT`, `dominant_zone = DEEP_VALUE`, bull lean) |
| **SELL** | `quorum_verdict = BEARISH` |
| **HOLD** | everything else |

The verdict — not a seat count — drives the signal; the deterministic **zone** and **trend** (`weekly_closes >= 200`) gates and the F&G Governor below still hard-cap what BULLISH can buy.

## Portfolio Governor — regime-aware buy cap

Before finalising signals, count total BUY + BUY(small) across all tokens. Apply the regime cap from the F&G index fetched this run:

| Regime (F&G)          | Max simultaneous BUYs |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Extreme Fear (0–24)   | 4                     |
| Fear (25–49)          | 6                     |
| Neutral+ (50–100)     | no cap                |

Perform these steps in order, even when no downgrades fire:

1. **Rank all BUY/BUY(small) by conviction (ascending)**: `bull_weight` asc (the conviction-weighted lean), then `confidence` asc (MED < HIGH). Print the ranked list.
2. **Count total BUYs** vs the cap.
3. **If total > cap**: downgrade from the bottom (lowest conviction first) until the cap is met. Print `⚠️ Governor: {n} BUY(s) downgraded to HOLD (regime cap F&G={value})`.
4. **If total ≤ cap**: no downgrades. Print the count vs cap in plain English (e.g. `✅ Governor: 2 buys within the cap of 4 — Extreme Fear, F&G=18`).

The ranking step makes downgrades auditable and catches upstream signal errors (e.g. a token scored BUY(small) despite quorum=UNCERTAIN). In a Fear regime it enforces the "60–70% dry powder" discipline a signal table alone cannot.

**WAIT / HOLD with a named buy-zone** (e.g. "not now, but buy AAVE near $73") → register a notify-me job carrying your thesis via the **`mkt`** skill. See §Set a buy-alert.

---

## Step 3 — Print the full run report

**Open with a 2–3 sentence exec recap** before Block 1. No headers — plain text. Format:

```
{High-conviction signal}: {TOKEN} — {1-line reason why: key indicator + zone + quorum}.
{Second signal if exists, else skip}.
Narrative: {1 sentence on the dominant market theme right now — regime, macro driver, what's moving the space}.
```

Rules:
- Lead with the highest-conviction BUY or SELL (most seats, clearest zone). Skip if nothing above HOLD.
- If all signals are HOLD, say so in one sentence + the dominant reason (e.g. "All 11 tokens HOLD — trend bearish, waiting for 200wMA reclaim").
- The narrative sentence must be grounded in a fetched source from this run. No URL = no claim.
- Under 3 sentences total. Flowing text, not a list.

Example:
```
AAVE is the only buy: down 62% from its high and sitting above its long-term average price floor at $62, with the on-chain and value lenses bullish at high conviction. LINK also worth watching — RSI at 23 (historically oversold) with real institutional adoption via Swift and Euroclear. Sentiment: Fear & Greed at 18 — the AI/tech selloff dragged crypto down hard this week while DeFi fundamentals (locked value, fees) held steady.
```

⛔ **Jargon banned from the exec recap:** Never write `DEEP_VALUE`, `FAIR_VALUE`, `ELEVATED`, `EXTREME`, `UNKNOWN`, `BULLISH`, `BEARISH`, `UNCERTAIN`, `seats_bull`, `seats_bear`, `quorum_verdict`, `0B/4Br`, or any internal code. Write what it means in plain English.

Print **three blocks** after the recap, in this exact order:

### Block 1 — Signal table (one-glance summary)
```
=== CRYPTO PORTFOLIO RUN — {timestamp} ===   (data: TradingView MCP)

Token | Signal      | Valuation | Quorum | Bulls/Bears
------|-------------|-----------|--------|------------
BTC   | HOLD        | fair      | SPLIT  | 2 / 2
ETH   | BUY (small) | cheap     | SPLIT  | 1 / 2
SOL   | BUY (small) | cheap     | SPLIT  | 3 / 1
...
```

### Block 2 — Plain-English verdict per token

For every token write the following **four mandatory sections** — no exceptions, no token skipped:

**1. Verdict (2–4 sentences, plain English)**
Cover: why this signal (1–2 key facts), news catalyst with `[source: https://...]` inline if any, main risk, what to watch (trigger to change signal). No jargon — write what the data means, not the code names.

**2. Research Desk recap (1 sentence per researcher, always present)**
Summarise what each Phase 1 researcher found. Pull directly from their briefs — do not invent.

```
Research Desk:
  Technical:   {1 sentence — price vs MAs, RSI, death/golden cross, MACD direction}
  On-Chain:    {1 sentence — MVRV-Z/NUPL/realized price/Puell; cycle position}
  DeFi:        {1 sentence — TVL/fees/revenue accrual; key protocol mechanic (or "n/a — L1" for BTC/ETH/SOL/TON)}
  Macro:       {1 sentence — GLI/M2/DXY/ETF flows; dominant macro driver}
  Smart Money: {1 sentence — exchange inflows/outflows, whale flows, OTC/positioning}
```

If a researcher returned INSUFFICIENT DATA, write that verbatim — never omit the line.

**3. Panel votes (1 line per investor)**
```
Panel:
  Graham (Value):          BULLISH|NEUTRAL|BEARISH — {reason citing briefing number}
  Buffett (Quality):       BULLISH|NEUTRAL|BEARISH — {reason}
  Dalio (Cycle):           BULLISH|NEUTRAL|BEARISH — {reason}
  Druckenmiller (Trend):   BULLISH|NEUTRAL|BEARISH — {reason}
  Alden (Debasement):      BULLISH|NEUTRAL|BEARISH — {reason}
  Burniske (On-chain):     BULLISH|NEUTRAL|BEARISH — {reason}
```

**4. Bull / Bear**
```
Bull: {1 sentence}
Bear: {1 sentence}
```

**⛔ HARD RULE for Block 2:** Every claim from a fetched article, data feed, or external source carries an inline `[source: https://...]` immediately after it. Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, death cross) computed from price data do NOT need a source; narrative facts (headlines, TVL, fund flows, institutional events) DO. A claim with no `[source:]` tag is unverified — remove it.

Example:
```
### BTC — HOLD

BTC is down 42% from its all-time high and sits on the 200-week moving average
(~$62k), the historical long-term floor. RSI has recovered to neutral (42.6)
and MACD is turning up. However a death cross is active (50-day below 200-day),
macro is hostile (Fed holding rates, strong dollar), and ETF flows are still
negative [source: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/06/21/btc-etf-outflows].
Not cheap enough on-chain to force a buy, not broken enough to sell.
Watch for a daily close above SMA50 ($71.9k) to upgrade to BUY.

Research Desk:
  Technical:   Price $62k, EMA20 $63.5k overhead, SMA50 $69.9k, death cross active; RSI 42.6 neutral; MACD hist +400 turning positive.
  On-Chain:    MVRV-Z 1.8 (neutral), realized price ~$47k — BTC trading at 1.3× realized price, not cheap but not bubble territory.
  DeFi:        n/a — L1 (no protocol revenue accrual).
  Macro:       Fed held rates 3.5–3.75%, Warsh hawkish, real yields rising, DXY strengthening — debasement trade unwinding [source: https://www.theblock.co/post/405152/crypto-markets-wobble-hawkish-fed].
  Smart Money: ETF outflows $1.79B last week (2nd worst ever) [source: https://www.theblock.co/post/406451/ibit-second-worst-week]; exchange inflows neutral.

Panel:
  Graham (Value):          NEUTRAL — FAIR_VALUE zone; 42% below ATH qualifies for margin-of-safety watch, not deep-value buy.
  Buffett (Quality):       BULLISH — 21M hard cap, undisputed monetary network moat; Saylor accumulation ongoing.
  Dalio (Cycle):           BULLISH — F&G 18 (Extreme Fear) triggers contrarian signal; historically strong entry region.
  Druckenmiller (Trend):   BEARISH — death cross active, RSI < 45, MACD still negative; all bearish conditions met.
  Alden (Debasement):      BULLISH — sound-money hardest asset; 21M cap is the debasement hedge, BTC is the hurdle every other asset must clear.
  Burniske (On-chain):     BULLISH — RSI 30 proxies MVRV undervaluation; realized price likely above spot.

Bull: Extreme Fear at RSI 30 historically marks major BTC cycle bottoms; institutional floor from Saylor accumulation.
Bear: Death cross + sustained ETF outflows + hawkish Fed — macro headwinds can keep price suppressed for months.

---

### ETH — BUY (small)

ETH has crashed 63% from its 52-week high and is now 36% below its 200-week
moving average — a level historically associated with cycle bottoms. The
Ethereum Foundation cut 20% of its workforce [source: https://www.theblock.co/post/405809/ethereum-foundation-cuts-20-staff],
adding organizational risk, but chain revenue holds at $3.1M/day [source: https://defillama.com/chain/ethereum].
Four of six panel seats bullish. Start a small tranche; upgrade to BUY on 200wMA reclaim.

Research Desk:
  Technical:   Death cross absent; RSI 31 (oversold); MACD hist barely negative (-1.8); EMA20 $1,698 overhead resistance.
  On-Chain:    NUPL negative (capitulation zone); 36% below 200wMA ($2,472) — historically rare discount; staking yield ~3-4%.
  DeFi:        Chain revenue $3.1M/day, TVL $37.6B stable [source: https://defillama.com/chain/ethereum]; EIP-4844 reduced L2 fees but base layer burn still positive.
  Macro:       EF restructuring adds FUD; EthLabs launch by 50+ stakeholders a counterweight; global risk-off depresses all alts.
  Smart Money: Corporate buyers active — Bitmine +$92M, Sharplink accumulating; one whale sold 33k ETH at $1,560 [source: https://www.theblock.co/post/406342/ethereum-og-wallets-sell].

Panel:
  Graham (Value):          BULLISH — DEEP_VALUE zone; 63% below 52w high, substantial margin of safety.
  Buffett (Quality):       BULLISH — dominant smart-contract layer, staking yield, deflationary burn, deep dev moat.
  Dalio (Cycle):           BULLISH — F&G 18 (Extreme Fear); ETH ended Q2 red, classic capitulation setup.
  Druckenmiller (Trend):   NEUTRAL — no death cross (positive), but RSI < 40 and MACD still negative; bullish condition not met.
  Alden (Debasement):      NEUTRAL — must clear the BTC hurdle to justify the risk; sound-money case is weaker than BTC's, productive-asset case unproven.
  Burniske (On-chain):     BULLISH — NUPL capitulation + 36% below 200wMA = staking yield at relative high vs price.

Bull: Spot ETF flows, staking yield, and deep-value zone converge at a historically rare oversold RSI.
Bear: MACD still negative; broader bear trend could extend toward $1,200–$1,400.
```

### Block 3 — News & sources used by the Research Desk
List every URL the research subagents fetched, with a one-line plain-English summary and its T1/T2/T3 rank.

```
--- RESEARCH SOURCES ---
(Only URLs you actually called web_fetch on — or that a feed script (feeds/wsj.ts/feeds/ft.ts/
read_news.ts) returned — appear here. No URL = no entry.
Every entry MUST start with https:// — source name alone is NOT acceptable.)

BTC research sources:
  [T1] https://api.alternative.me/fng/?limit=1 — "value: 18, value_classification: Extreme Fear" → T1: hard numeric index with timestamp, directly measures crowd fear
  [T2] https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/06/21/bitcoin-options-traders-scrambling → "Bitcoin traders are scrambling to buy options bets that would pay off if the selloff deepens" → T2: named-source journalism, live positioning data
  [T3] https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/06/20/bitcoin-54k-analyst-forecast → "Bitcoin price may be headed to $54,000, says analyst who forecast October's all-time high" → T3: analyst opinion, useful for risk framing, no hard data
  [FETCH FAILED: https://www.theblock.co/latest] — no BTC-specific articles visible
```
(DeFiLlama T1 example: `[T1] https://defillama.com/chain/ethereum — "Chain Revenue (24h)$65,225... App Revenue (24h)$1.1m... Bridged TVL$349.351b"` — exact metric string, not a paraphrase.)

⛔ Each entry is `[Tn] https://<article-url> — "<quote>"`. A bare source name (`T1 — CoinDesk`) with no `https://` URL is a hallucination — do not write it.

Self-check before printing:
- Every token has `status='done'` in `token_analysis`
- `seats_bull + seats_bear <= 6` for each token
- **Block 2 researcher recap present for every token** — 5 lines (Technical/On-Chain/DeFi/Macro/Smart Money), no line omitted
- **Block 2 panel votes present for every token** — 6 lines (Graham/Buffett/Dalio/Druckenmiller/Alden/Burniske)
- Every research source entry starts with `https://` followed by the **specific article URL** (not a listing/search page) — else remove it and mark INSUFFICIENT DATA
- **Two-step verified**: news citations point to the article URL you fetched (step 2), not the listing page (step 1)
- **Block 2 inline links**: every news-based claim has `[source: https://...]` — scan each verdict; remove any fact with no source tag
- A TradingView screenshot is embedded inline (via `view` tool on the `file_path`) for every token
- **No source cited that was not actually fetched this run** — verify "did I web_fetch this exact URL, or did a feed script return it?" If neither, remove it

---

## Step 4 — Verdict Critic (post-hook: substance check)

**Run before printing Block 1.** For every token, a fresh subagent — with no memory of the quorum — reads today's news and challenges the verdict. This catches verdicts that are consistent with the data package but contradict something happening in the real world right now.

**⛔ PRE-FLIGHT CRITIC COUNT:** Before spawning critics, write the full list of tokens to critique, one per line, and count them. The count MUST equal the universe size (default 11). Critique **every** token, HOLDs included — a HOLD can be wrong (the original UNI error was a HOLD with stale "no fee accrual" tokenomics). Write this before calling any critic:
```
Critic list (must equal universe count):
1. BTC — HOLD
2. ETH — SELL
...
11. LINK — HOLD
Total: 11/11 ✓
```
If your total is < universe count, add the missing rows before proceeding.

**4a. For every token, spawn a verdict-critic subagent in parallel.** ⛔ Partial coverage is INCOMPLETE. Pass it the token symbol, the full quorum verdict text (signal, zone, quorum, all 6 investor votes, key claims from the briefing), and this prompt:

```
Return EXACTLY this format:

CRITIC — {TOKEN}
News fetched:
  [1] https://<url-you-fetched> — "<verbatim quote from page>"
  [2] https://<url-you-fetched> — "<verbatim quote from page>"
  [3] https://<defillama-url> — "<protocol revenue or description quote>"

Q1 DIRECTION:   PASS | FLAG — <one sentence>
Q2 STALE MECH:  PASS | FLAG — <one sentence, cite the specific claim and the contradicting evidence>
Q3 MISSING:     PASS | FLAG — <one sentence, cite the missing event and its URL>
Q4 OVERCONF:    PASS | FLAG — <quote the overconfident phrase>

OVERALL: PASS | FLAG
If FLAG: "<specific verdict text that must be corrected> → correct to: <corrected claim with source URL>"

Token: {TOKEN}
Verdict to critique:
{paste full quorum verdict block}

Task:
1. Fetch and read:
   a. web_fetch https://www.theblock.co/search?query={TOKEN}+crypto (recent news listing)
   b. web_fetch the most relevant article URL from (a) — the one most likely to challenge the verdict
   c. web_fetch https://defillama.com/protocol/{slug} (protocol metrics and revenue)
2. Answer each question:
   Q1 DIRECTION: Does today's news point in the OPPOSITE direction from the signal?
      (e.g. verdict=BEARISH but news says "protocol launches major feature, TVL up 40%")
   Q2 STALE MECHANICS: Does the verdict make a categorical mechanics claim (fee switch, buyback, burn,
      revenue accrual, governance status) that the news or DeFiLlama contradicts? Red-flag phrases:
      "no fee accrual", "governance only", "no buyback", "fees go to LPs only", "fee switch pending",
      "never passed" — verify each against live data.
   Q3 MISSING CATALYST: Is there a major event (governance vote passed, exploit, institutional adoption,
      regulatory decision, partnership) the verdict completely ignores?
   Q4 OVERCONFIDENCE: Does the verdict use absolute language ("permanently", "structurally", "will never",
      "always has been") about something governance or market conditions could change?

Constraints: You are a devil's advocate — find problems, do not confirm. You have NO prior knowledge of
this run; start fresh. You have only web_fetch, not TradingView — you read the world, not the chart.
```

**4b. Print all critic reports** for all tokens in sequence.

**4c. Act on FLAGs before printing Block 1:**
- `OVERALL: FLAG` on any token → **revise that token's quorum verdict** to address the critique, re-run the signal decision, and mark it `⚠️ REVISED` in Block 1.
- `OVERALL: PASS` on all tokens → print `✅ Verdict Critic: {n}/{total} tokens reviewed` where `n` must equal `total`. ⛔ If n < total, the run is INCOMPLETE — do not proceed to Block 1.

⛔ **SELF-CHECK BEFORE BLOCK 1:** Verify `n == total` by re-reading the pre-flight critic list. If any token is missing a printed `CRITIC — {TOKEN}` / `OVERALL` result, run the missing critics now. Do not print Block 1 until all critics are printed and counted.

---

## Step 5 — Citation validation (post-hook: format check)

After printing Block 3, run the `reference-validator` post-hook to verify every research-seat source is real.

**5a. Assemble the citations JSON** — collect every `[T1]`/`[T2]`/`[T3]` entry from Block 3 with a real `https://` URL (skip `[FETCH FAILED]`):

```json
[
  {"token":"BTC","tier":"T1","url":"https://api.alternative.me/fng/?limit=1","quote":"value: 18, value_classification: Extreme Fear"},
  {"token":"BTC","tier":"T2","url":"https://www.coindesk.com/search?q=bitcoin+ETF+2026","quote":"Bitcoin ETF products saw $218M outflow"},
  ...
]
```

**5b. Spawn `reference-validator` as a subagent** — pass the full JSON array. It re-fetches every URL and checks the quoted text is present (subagents have `web_fetch`; only `tradingview-*` is orchestrator-only).

⛔ **Non-skippable:** the subagent must actually run and its raw output must be printed verbatim in 5c. Self-attested checkmarks ("all citations verified") do NOT satisfy this step. If the subagent is not spawned, mark the run INCOMPLETE.

```
Invoke the reference-validator skill with this citations JSON:
[...paste array here...]
```

**5c. Print the validation report** returned by the subagent verbatim — do not edit it.

**5d. Act on failures:**
- Any token with ≥1 `NOT_FOUND` source → append `⚠️ CITATION_FAILED` to that token's signal in Block 1 and note it in Block 2.
- Any token with only `FETCH_FAILED` sources → append `ℹ️ UNVERIFIED` to that token's signal.
- If ALL sources for ALL tokens are `VERIFIED` or `PARTIAL` → print `✅ All citations verified`.

---

## Step 6 — Telegram daily recap (append after both post-hooks)

After Block 3 and citation validation, print the Telegram message for @CryptoAiInvestor.

**Three mandatory elements per token — no exceptions:**

1. **Market data** — price, RSI, MACD line vs signal, EMA20 vs SMA200 (above/below), % from ATH
2. **6-seat investment panel recap** — exactly 1 sentence per seat (Value / Quality / Cycle / Trend / Debasement / On-chain): what that investor saw from the briefing and how they voted
3. **All source links** — every URL fetched for this token by the Research Desk, with a 1-line description. If none, write `no sources fetched` — never omit or fabricate

A token entry without all three is incomplete. Write them in this order per token:

```
{EMOJI} {TOKEN} ${price} | RSI {rsi} | MACD {direction} | {above/below} 4yr avg | {pct}% below ATH
{SIGNAL_EMOJI} {SIGNAL} — {1-sentence plain-English reason: what the data shows + why it drives this signal}

📊 Investment panel ({N}/6 bullish):
  Value (Graham): {1 sentence — margin of safety assessment from briefing; how this seat voted}
  Quality (Buffett): {1 sentence — moat/revenue quality from briefing; how this seat voted}
  Cycle (Dalio): {1 sentence — macro regime/liquidity cycle from briefing; how this seat voted}
  Trend (Druckenmiller): {1 sentence — price structure/momentum from briefing; how this seat voted}
  Debasement (Alden): {1 sentence — fiscal dominance/BTC-hurdle/live macro context from briefing; how this seat voted}
  On-chain (Burniske): {1 sentence — fee capture/protocol flows from briefing; how this seat voted}

📰 Sources:
  • https://... — {outlet, 1-line description of what it showed}
  • https://... — ...

📌 {Action note: entry level / stop / what to watch for a reversal}
```

**Full message wrapper:**

```
📊 Daily Crypto Brief — {DATE}

🌡️ Fear & Greed: {value} ({classification})
⚠️ {1-sentence macro regime summary}

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
{token block 1}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
{token block 2}
...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📅 Watch: {2–3 upcoming catalysts with dates}

Educational only. Not financial advice. DYOR.
```

**Concrete example (AAVE BUY):**

```
Ⓐ AAVE $92.18 | RSI 40 | MACD flattening | below 4yr avg ($140) | 34% below 4yr avg
🟢 BUY — DeFi lending leader at deep discount: $27B locked, real yield from borrowing spreads + GHO fees, buy-distribute program live; CORE lenses (on-chain + value) bullish with high conviction
📊 Investment panel (bull lean, on-chain + value lead):
  Value (Graham): $27B TVL at $92 implies deep margin of safety vs historical revenue multiples; voted BUY [HIGH]
  Quality (Buffett): GHO growth + dominant lending moat defensible; revenue quality high; voted BUY [MED]
  Cycle (Dalio): rate headwinds present but AAVE real yield partially hedges; risk-parity neutral; voted NEUTRAL
  Trend (Druckenmiller): price below all MAs, no trend reversal yet — caution on size; voted BUY (small) [LOW]
  Debasement (Alden): clears the BTC-as-hurdle test — real fee yield, not just monetary premium; voted BUY [MED]
  On-chain (Burniske): fee-switch buybacks confirmed on DeFiLlama; protocol cash flows accruing to holders; voted BUY [HIGH]

📰 Sources:
  • https://defillama.com/protocol/aave — TVL $27B, protocol revenue confirmed, buy-distribute live

📌 Tranches at $80–95. Max 30% of position at once (Extreme Fear). Stop: $75.
```

**⛔ JARGON BAN — these codes must never appear in the Telegram output:**

`DEEP_VALUE`, `FAIR_VALUE`, `ELEVATED`, `EXTREME`, `UNKNOWN`, `BULLISH`, `BEARISH`, `UNCERTAIN`, `SPLIT`, `dominant_zone`, `seats_bull`, `seats_bear`, `quorum_verdict`, `3B/1Br`, `0B/4Br`, `INSUFFICIENT`, `confidence` labels

Plain-English replacements:
- Zone labels → `{pct}% below ATH` or `{pct}% below 4yr avg` — the number tells the story
- Seat counts → name the leaning CORE lenses in plain English (e.g. `on-chain + value lead bullish`); the panel block explains each with its conviction
- `UNKNOWN` zone → `only {N} months of price history — 4yr average not yet available`

**Telegram length limit is 4096 bytes per message (hard limit).** With full panel + sources, 11 tokens exceed one message. Split at token boundaries:
- Part 1: header + BUY/SELL tokens (highest priority)
- Part 2: remaining HOLD tokens + watch list + disclaimer
- Send each part: `python3 telegram-cli.py send @CryptoAiInvestor "$PART_N"`
- ⛔ Never use `head -c N` — silently truncates multibyte emoji

**⛔ If no URL was fetched for a token, write `📰 Sources: none fetched this run` — never fabricate a source.**

---

## Step 7 — Publish to Notion (config-gated)

Only runs if `.cache/crypto-advisor/notion.yaml` exists and `enabled: true`.

**7a. Read the config:**
```bash
CONFIG=".cache/crypto-advisor/notion.yaml"
[ -f "$CONFIG" ] && ENABLED=$(python3 -c "import yaml,sys; c=yaml.safe_load(open('$CONFIG')); print(c.get('enabled','false'))") || ENABLED=false
```

**7b. Build the page title** using `title_template` from the config. Derive each variable from the completed run:
- `{date}` → today's date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `{fg_label}` → map the F&G value used in Step 2: 0–24 → `xfear`; 25–49 → `fear`; 50–74 → `neutral`; 75–89 → `greed`; 90–100 → `xgreed`
- `{signals}` → top 1–2 BUY/BUY(small) tokens (by conviction, highest first), uppercase, space-joined, append ` buy`; if none, use `all hold`. Examples: `AAVE buy`, `AAVE LINK buy`, `all hold`

Full title example: `2026-06-26 xfear AAVE buy`

**7c. Create the Notion page:**

```
notion-create-pages
  parent: {"type": "page_id", "page_id": "<parent_page_id from config>"}
  pages: [{
    "properties": {"title": "<computed title>"},
    "content": "<full report markdown: Block 1 + Block 2 + Block 3 + Telegram recap>"
  }]
```

Paste the blocks verbatim — no reformatting.

**7d. Save to local file** (always — even if Notion is disabled):

```bash
TITLE="{computed title}"   # e.g. "2026-06-26 xfear AAVE buy"
mkdir -p .cache/crypto-advisor/research
python3 -c "
import sys
title = sys.argv[1]
content = sys.argv[2]
with open(f'.cache/crypto-advisor/research/{title}.md', 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
" "$TITLE" "$FULL_REPORT_MARKDOWN"
```

`$FULL_REPORT_MARKDOWN` = exec recap + Block 1 + Block 2 + Block 3 + Telegram recap, concatenated.

**7e. Print the result:**
```
✅ Saved: .cache/crypto-advisor/research/{title}.md
✅ Notion: https://app.notion.com/p/<page-id>   ← only if Notion enabled
```

If the config is absent or `enabled: false`, still save the file (7d always runs); skip Notion (7c).

---

## Set a buy-alert (notify-me-when) — for WAIT / buy-zone verdicts

When a verdict is "not yet, but buy at $X" or "act when RSI/MACD hits V", offer to register a durable alert via the **`mkt`** skill — it carries the thesis into the notification (mkt's native message cannot):

```bash
cd .agents/skills/mkt/scripts
bun mkt-alert.ts add --desk crypto --symbol AAVE-USD \
  --condition below --value 73 \
  --reason "Denied Kraken-rumor pop fading; \$73 = EMA20 reclaim. Buy tranche 1." \
  --channel telegram:@CryptoAiInvestor --expiry 2026-07-31
```

Indicator and compound buy-zones map to mkt conditions (`rsi_below`, `macd_cross`, `above`+`macd_cross` with `--match all`). A scheduled `bun check.ts` (runtime cron) then fires the notification with the reasoning. See `.agents/skills/mkt/SKILL.md` for the trigger patterns and scheduler cookbook. Recommend-only.

Use Coinbase symbol format: `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`, `AAVE-USD`, `SOL-USD` (dashes, **not** `BTCUSDT`) — quotes stream live from Coinbase WS (real-time, no geo-block). A thin alt with no Coinbase feed returns no quote and that one job is skipped; keep alerts to universe tokens (all have Coinbase feeds).

## Running continuously

```
/loop interval=6h
/stop
```

On each loop, re-seed any `pending`/missing todos and resume the sequential pull — never start a second data pull while one is in flight.

## Deploy methodology references
- Sizing & DCA: `references/execution-dca-and-sizing.md` (valuation-tilted DCA, vol-target sizing)
- Honest assessment: `references/crypto-honest-assessment.md` (why TA day-timing fails after costs; DeFi failure modes)
- Provenance: `references/onchain-methodology-provenance.md`
- Alt selection (BTC-as-hurdle): `crypto-token-screener` → `references/btc-as-hurdle.md`
