// Regression guard for the hedge-fund-committee discovery GATE contract.
// The fatal SanDisk bug: a single-source NARRATIVE name (SNDK, conviction 3) was filtered out before the
// panel. This test pins the contract so it can never silently regress.  Run: `node test_gate_contract.mjs`
//
// Constraint: the workflow runs in a sandbox that forbids importing local modules, so the gate predicate
// cannot be shared via `import` and the test cannot execute the real function directly. Rather than fragile
// regex-eval of the whole predicate, this test does two robust things:
//   PART A — SOURCE INVARIANT (the real regression guard): assert the actual workflow source still contains
//            the narrative clause and that NARRATIVE_DESKS still includes the news seats. Removing the
//            narrative clause (the exact SanDisk regression) makes this FAIL.
//   PART B — BEHAVIOURAL CONTRACT: a small mirror of the predicate documents expected admit/drop outcomes.
//            (Clearly a mirror — Part A is what binds it to the real code.)
