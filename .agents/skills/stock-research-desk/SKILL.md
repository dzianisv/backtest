# Stock research desk — consolidate the brief

Merge the raw data seats into ONE dense, factual brief on the stock(s)/portfolio in question, as of the given date. **No recommendations** — this is the evidence the panel debates.

## Sections (in order)
1. **QUESTION & PORTFOLIO** — restate the user's question + current holdings/exposure verbatim so every downstream seat sees it.
2. **VALUATION & QUALITY** — P/E, EV/EBIT, FCF yield, ROIC/ROE, margins, moat read; price vs fair-value/intrinsic estimate (state the discount/premium).
3. **DRAWDOWN / PRICE LEVEL** — % below 52-week high, distance to support, relevant entry levels.
4. **TECHNICALS / TREND** — price vs 200-day, trend, momentum, breadth context.
5. **INSTITUTIONAL CONVICTION** — 13F initiations/adds/trims, cross-fund clusters (45-day lagged); flag puts/exits.
6. **CONGRESSIONAL BUYS** — recent STOCK Act purchases in the name/sector (30–45 day lag; long-only personal accounts).
7. **EQUITY REGIME** — risk-on vs risk-off, exposure dial.
8. **MACRO (CPI/FOMC/rates/liquidity)** — Fed tone delta, rate path, liquidity backdrop.
9. **NEWS / NARRATIVE** — catalysts + source-count + priced-in tag (`[UNAVAILABLE]` if no news seat ran).
10. **CROSS-SOURCE CONFLICTS** — surface disagreements (e.g. cheap on FCF but technically broken); do not average them away.
11. **DATA GAPS**.

## Rules
- Every number keeps its `as-of` + `source`. Quote, don't paraphrase, priced figures.
- **Completeness contract:** if a required category is `[UNAVAILABLE]`, write `[UNAVAILABLE — <category> seat failed to return]` in its section AND list it in §11 DATA GAPS at the top. Never paper over a gap.
- Surface conflicts in §10; do not average them away.
- Be dense and neutral. No verdicts, no sizing, no "should."

## Done when
All 11 sections present; every figure sourced + dated; gaps and conflicts explicit.
