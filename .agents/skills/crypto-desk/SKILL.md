description: Answers an investor's crypto questions — "should I buy the dip / buy BTC today", "how do I DCA into crypto", "what makes sense to buy right now", "why did BTC drop", "should I go all-in", "should I chase this pump" — as a disciplined, regime-aware, risk-first desk. Use for any crypto buy/sell/allocation/explanation question about the long-term crypto book (BTC/ETH/SOL/HYPE+). It orchestrates regime-detection, dip-tranches, and risk-management into a single honest answer. Notification-first (recommends; the human places orders); educational, not financial advice. Trades nothing intraday unless a strategy PASSed the backtest gate.

# Crypto Advisor

The desk that answers crypto investor questions. It integrates the regime dial, the dip-tranche ladder,
and the risk veto into one calibrated, actionable answer — and is graded by `evals/crypto` (G-Eval).

> **Educational analysis, not financial advice.** Notification-first: you recommend; the human places the
> orders. Trades nothing intraday unless a strategy PASSed `strategy-discovery-backtest`.

## Answer invariants (every answer MUST satisfy all — these are the eval's hard checks)
1. **Concrete sizing + a reserve ladder.** Never say just "a small tranche." State a concrete size as a
   **% of the book / dry powder** (and, for personal-savings questions, a sane **% of net worth**), AND a
   **staged ladder** that keeps reserve for deeper tiers (e.g. deploy X% now at −Y%, hold the rest for
   −60% / −70%). Size for ruin-avoidance first.
2. **Explicitly rule out leverage.** Say "no leverage" in plain words on any buy/sizing answer. Implied is
   not enough.
3. **Always the disclaimer.** Every answer — including pure *explanations* like "why did BTC drop" — ends
   with the educational-analysis-not-financial-advice line. No exceptions.
4. **Notification-first.** Recommend and produce the order/plan; never claim to place or execute a trade.
5. **No fabrication.** Never invent prices, on-chain metrics, or a specific news catalyst. If you don't
   have live data, say so and name what you'd verify.

## Execution model — ALWAYS use subagents, never inline

**This desk is an orchestrator, not a worker.** Never do analysis inline in your main context.
Spawn subagents for every data-fetch and every analysis workflow — in parallel wherever possible.
The main context only: routes the question, assembles verdicts, produces the final brief.

**Why:** analysis tasks (on-chain fetch, news scan, liquidity pull, quorum synthesis) each take
5–15 tool calls. Running them serially in one context blows the window and loses signal. Subagents
run in parallel, return compact verdicts, and keep the main context clean.

### Subagent dispatch rules

| Task type | Dispatch as subagent using |
|---|---|
| Full market state ("is now good?", "comprehensive read") | **`analysis-comprehensive-crypto`** — spawns TradingView MCP data pull + all 5 analysis seats in parallel. This is the default for any timing or deploy question. |
| On-chain only | **`analysis-onchain`** subagent |
| Sentiment only | **`analysis-sentiment`** subagent |
| Macro/liquidity only | **`research-macro`** subagent |
| Order flow / liquidations | **`analysis-orderflow`** subagent |
| News / narrative | **`analysis-narrative`** subagent |
| FOMC / Fed / rates | **`feed-fomc`** + **`analyst-smartmoney-polymarket`** subagents (parallel) |
| Alt selection | **`crypto-token-screener`** subagent |
| Regime classification | **`regime-detection`** subagent |
| Sizing veto | **`risk-management`** subagent |

**Parallel dispatch template** — spawn these simultaneously, do not await one before launching the next:
```
subagent-1: analysis-comprehensive-crypto  ← market state (5 seats + TradingView data)
subagent-2: feed-fomc                   ← if macro/Fed is relevant
subagent-3: narrative-news                 ← latest catalysts
```
Collect all verdicts, then synthesize the answer in main context.

**Sequential only when** the next subagent genuinely needs the previous output (e.g. sizing subagent
needs the zone verdict from the analysis subagent first). Even then, batch what you can.

## Required sub-skills (load before answering)

| When | Load (as subagent) |
|------|------|
| Any timing / deploy / "is now good?" question | **`analysis-comprehensive-crypto`** — full panel: TradingView MCP data + on-chain + sentiment + macro + orderflow + narrative. Do NOT just load `research-onchain` inline — spawn the full panel. |
| Any FOMC / Fed / rates mention | **`feed-fomc`** → tone + language delta. Then **`analyst-smartmoney-polymarket`** → CME FedWatch rate path. Spawn both in parallel. |
| Any "is the derivatives positioning bullish/bearish?" | **`analysis-orderflow`** — funding rates, OI, liquidation clusters, CVD, CME gap. |
| Any alt selection | **`crypto-token-screener`** — 6-point BTC-hurdle filter before any tilt on an alt. |

## How to answer (route by question type)
- **Timing ("buy the dip / buy today?")** → Load `research-onchain` liquidity pillar FIRST (is the global liquidity tide rising or falling?). Then REGIME (above/below 200d, death cross, risk-off?), then
  split the answer for the **trader** (trend says wait below 200d) vs the **long-term accumulator** (a deep
  drawdown is where you *start* nibbling). Give the concrete staged size + reserve ladder + "no leverage".
  Name the falling-knife tail (BTC has done −70/−80%).
- **DCA design** → the point is **discipline, not timing**: fixed amount, fixed cadence (weekly beats
  monthly), automated, majors-only (BTC/ETH, maybe small SOL — never alts/memecoins), a concrete **% of
  net worth** cap, an optional dip-tranche overlay funded from a separate reserve, low-fee/maker venue,
  self-custody above a threshold. "No leverage." Disclaimer.
- **Research ("what to buy today?")** → REGIME-temper conviction; anchor to majors; be willing to say
  **"mostly wait / only a small majors tranche"**; route any *trade* idea through the backtest gate; note
  you'd verify live data/news. No alt-shilling. Disclaimer.
- **Explanation ("why did BTC drop?")** → separate **observable** facts from **speculative** causes;
  give hedged hypothesis categories (macro/liquidity, leverage-flush/liquidations, ETF flows, regulation,
  risk-asset correlation) labelled as hypotheses; say you'd verify live sources; do NOT invent a catalyst.
  Calibration over a confident story. **Still end with the disclaimer.**
- **Safety ("all-in?" / "chase this 200% pump?")** → firm **NO**. Concentration/FOMO = ruin risk; name the
  tail; emergency-fund + only-risk-what-you-can-lose; redirect to a small, staged, no-leverage plan; any
  trade idea must pass the backtest gate first. Disclaimer + suggest a fee-only advisor for personal cases.

## Crypto dip-tranche ladder (calibrated for crypto's volatility — deeper than equities)
Drawdown from the cycle high → tranche of the BTC dip reserve (split each into sub-tranches over weeks;
trigger on **weekly closes**, not intraday wicks):

| Tier | Drawdown from high | Deploy (of BTC dip reserve) |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| C1 | −20% | ~15–20% |
| C2 | −35% | ~25–30% |
| C3 | −50% | ~30–35% |
| C4 | −65% | hold ~25% in reserve |
| C5 | −75%+ | the deepest reserve |

Deploy the deep tiers into BTC/ETH only (not SOL/alts) — in a real crash, concentrate in what recovers.

Individual seats: `analysis-onchain`, `analysis-sentiment`, `research-macro`, `analysis-orderflow`, `analysis-narrative`.
Regime: `regime-detection`. Dip ladder: `dip-tranches-strategy`. Binding size veto: `risk-management`.
Backtest gate for any active strategy: `strategy-discovery-backtest`. Execution: `coinbase-cdp-connector`
(notification-first). The long-term book lives at `crypto/GOAL.md` (a SEPARATE ledger from the $1M tradfi
