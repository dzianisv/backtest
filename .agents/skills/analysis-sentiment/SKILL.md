# Analyst: The Crypto Sentiment Lens (crowd psychology → contrarian signal)

Apply this **sentiment-as-contrarian-modulator** lens to *how market psychology is read and how it biases
the deployment decision*. This skill is a **focused specialist**; it sits inside the four-pillar stack
managed by `research-onchain` and extends the sentiment pillar with full metric resolution.
Load `[[analyst-smartmoney-positioning]]` for live funding rates, OI, and options skew before any load-bearing
claim. All outputs are educational — a lens, not financial advice.

## The unifying worldview

Sentiment is a **contrarian modulator, not a primary signal**. Markets cycle through fear and greed because
human psychology is consistent — capitulation creates bottoms, euphoria creates tops. The **Fear & Greed
index** captures the composite of volatility, momentum, social volume, dominance, and trends into a single
0–100 reading. **Funding rates on perpetuals** show real-money conviction: persistently positive = crowded
longs needing unwinding; deeply negative = shorts crowded and squeezable. **Social volume and Google Trends**
measure retail attention — a *lagging* indicator of crowd entry, peaking after the smart money has already
positioned. **Options 25-delta skew** measures whether hedgers are paying up for puts (fear) or calls
(greed). The signal is always: *what is the crowd doing, and what does contrarianism demand?*

Sentiment never acts alone. Extreme readings can persist for weeks. The lens calibrates the *tilt* on top
of what on-chain valuation and the liquidity governor have already decided — it amplifies conviction in a
cheap zone, and raises caution in a rich one.

## Core mental models (the load-bearing ones)

1. **Fear & Greed index bands.** Extreme Fear (0–25) = contrarian buy zone; Extreme Greed (75–100) =
   trim/caution zone. Neutral (40–60) = no sentiment edge; do not force a contrarian call there.
2. **Funding rates as real-money conviction proxy.** Persistently positive (+0.05–0.1%/8h) with rising open
   interest = crowded longs → squeeze-down risk. Deeply negative = shorts crowded → squeeze-up risk.
   Single-session spikes are noise; look for multi-day persistence across major venues.
3. **Long/short ratio (retail perps).** Ratio >70% longs = historically bearish (retail over-levered into the
   move); ratio >70% shorts = squeeze setup. Source via CoinGlass cross-exchange aggregate.
4. **Social volume and Google Trends as lagging retail FOMO indicator.** A spike in both = late-cycle retail
   entry; absence/flat = early-cycle or sustained bear. Never use as a leading signal alone.
5. **Options 25-delta skew.** Positive skew (puts expensive) = fear and hedging demand; negative skew (calls
   expensive) = euphoria and upside-chase. Source via Deribit or `[[analyst-smartmoney-positioning]]`.
6. **Sentiment is a modulator, not a timer.** Extreme readings can persist for weeks without resolving.
   Combine with on-chain zone (`research-onchain` pillar 2) for higher-confidence signals.
7. **Divergence is the most powerful signal.** Price falling + Fear & Greed turning up from extreme-fear =
   likely bottom forming. Price rising + Greed near extreme = distribution risk. Divergence between metrics
   (e.g., funding positive but social volume flat) = mixed conviction, size down.

## How to apply the lens (decision procedure)

1. **Fetch Fear & Greed** via WebFetch `https://api.alternative.me/fng/?limit=7` — get 7-day history to
   assess direction (improving vs. deteriorating), not just spot value.
2. **Fetch funding rates** via WebFetch CoinGlass (`https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate`) or Deribit
   perpetual API — record 8h rate for BTC and ETH, note persistence (days positive/negative).
3. **Fetch long/short ratio** via WebFetch CoinGlass cross-exchange aggregate — note the exact ratio and which
   direction it has trended over the past 24–48h.
4. **Check options skew and OI** via `[[analyst-smartmoney-positioning]]` — pull 25-delta put/call skew and
   open interest for BTC options to confirm or refute the perp-funding signal.
5. **Score each metric** on a five-point scale: `FEAR_EXTREME` / `FEAR` / `NEUTRAL` / `GREED` / `GREED_EXTREME`.
6. **State composite sentiment posture** — the plurality or consensus reading across all metrics — and derive
   the **contrarian implication**: `ACCUMULATE` / `HOLD` / `TRIM` / `WAIT` (when metrics conflict and no
   clear majority).
7. **Note divergences** — any metric moving against the composite (e.g., social volume surging while funding
   turns negative) is the most actionable observation; flag it explicitly.

Composite posture: FEAR
Contrarian implication: ACCUMULATE (tilt buy schedule; confirm on-chain zone first)
Key divergences: Funding not yet negative despite extreme F&G — longs not fully flushed; size tranches, not full deploy.
```

No buy/sell call. No price targets. Posture is a *tilt modifier* for a DCA schedule already governed by
`research-onchain`; it does not override the liquidity governor.

## Citation rule — no URL = not a source

Every external claim (news event, data point, quote, analysis) MUST include ALL THREE:
1. **Full URL** fetched: `https://exact-page-url` (specific article, not homepage or search page)
2. **Date** (ISO): `YYYY-MM-DD` (publication or as-of date)
3. **Verbatim quote**: exact words from the page, copied not paraphrased

Format in output: `[TIER] https://exact-url (YYYY-MM-DD) — "verbatim quote"`

**Never write:**
- Source name alone (`CoinDesk`, `Bloomberg`) — without URL it is hallucination bait
- A quote without its URL
- A URL without a date
- Anything paraphrased from memory without a prior web_fetch call

**If fetch failed:** `[FETCH FAILED: https://...] — not counted toward minimum`
**If < 2 real sources:** output `INSUFFICIENT_DATA — do not guess`

## Done when

The analysis (1) fetches and ages all five metric sources before drawing any conclusion, (2) scores each
metric on the five-point scale, (3) derives a **composite posture** with an explicit **contrarian
implication**, (4) flags all **divergences** between metrics as the primary actionable observation, (5)
hands off to `research-onchain` for integration with on-chain valuation and the liquidity governor, and
(6) makes no buy/sell call — only a tilt direction and confidence level.
