description: Screen S&P 100 for quality stocks trading >= 20%/25%/30% below their 52-week high. Fires an immediate alert when a HIGH-conviction dip (>= -30%) aligns with a RISK_ON regime. Use when asked "what quality stocks are on sale", "what fell from highs", "any big dips in the market", "catch the next Google dip", "fallen angels", or on the daily proactive schedule. Never re-proposes the same alert within the same calendar week.

# Dip Screener (S&P 100 quality stocks below 52-week high)

Scans the S&P 100 daily for stocks meaningfully below their 52-week high. The goal: catch the next **Google -30% from ATH** or **Meta -40% from ATH** — quality names, temporary dislocation, opportunity.

## Why this matters

Most opportunities are missed because no one was watching. Google dropped -30% from its ATH in Spring 2025 while journalists were writing about AI doom. SanDisk (WDC) appeared in FT/WSJ as AI supply chain in Sept 2025. Both were obvious in hindsight. This screener runs before you wake up and surfaces them.

## Hard rule

**RECOMMEND ONLY.** No trades, no orders. Output = candidates for quorum review. Educational analysis, not advice.

## Two execution paths (pick by backend)

**A. Local backend (claude-code / hermes — Python + yfinance):** full S&P 100 scan.
```bash
python3 .agents/skills/dip-screener/dip_screener.py --threshold 20
```

**B. openclaw pod (NO Python — node+curl only):** the `.py` won't run. 100 sequential `web_fetch`
calls are infeasible (rate limits), so scan the **curated quality watchlist** below via `web_fetch`,
one ticker at a time, same math as regime-detection's chart parse:
```
For each T in WATCHLIST:
  web_fetch https://query2.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/<T>?range=1y&interval=1d
  q=result[0].indicators.quote[0] ; current=last(q.close) ; high_52w=max(q.high)
  sma200 = mean(last 200 closes, else null) ; pct_from_high = (current-high_52w)/high_52w*100
  tier: HIGH ≤-30 | MED ≤-25 | WATCH ≤-20
```
WATCHLIST (the "next Google" universe — large quality names worth catching on a dip; ~25):
`GOOGL MSFT AAPL AMZN META NVDA AVGO ADBE CRM NOW ORCL ACN NFLX TMO DHR ABT ISRG ZTS LLY UNH V MA COST HD LOW`.
429 → retry once, then mark `[UNAVAILABLE]`, continue. Never fabricate. (Pod path trades coverage for
feasibility; the full 100-name scan runs on local backends.)

Output fields: `ticker`, `pct_from_high`, `high_52w`, `current`, `sma200`, `pct_vs_200d`, `as_of`, `conviction`. (`high_52w` = trailing-1y intraday high, not all-time; `sma200` null if <200d history; `as_of` = the ISO date of THIS ticker's own last data row, so each quote's date label is always correct.)

`--json` output is `{"hits": [...], "fetch_misses": [...]}`. A constituent that returns no data is retried once via a single-ticker fetch; if still empty it is reported in `fetch_misses` (and as a `[FETCH-MISS]` line in text mode) — **never silently dropped and never falsely labelled "delisted"** (these are transient Yahoo feed misses, e.g. MMC). The durable `--emit-pool` jsonl contract is unchanged (only HIGH/MEDIUM hits, same row schema).

**Price-ground mode (`--tickers A,B,C`):** ground an ARBITRARY list of tickers — NOT the S&P-100 universe and with NO dip threshold (a name may be UP). Returns `{"grounded": [...], "fetch_misses": [...]}` where each grounded row has the same fields (`current`/`high_52w`/`pct_from_high`/`sma200`/`pct_vs_200d`/`as_of`). Used by the hedge-fund-committee workflow to attach a live, paywall-independent 52w-high/200dMA to narrative names the news desk surfaced (decoupling discovery from pricing). A ticker with no yfinance data lands in `fetch_misses` (honest, not dropped). Example:
```
python3 .agents/skills/dip-screener/dip_screener.py --tickers LEU,KGS,POWL,MSFT
```

**2nd-source cross-check (accepted limitation):** quotes are single-source yfinance. A stooq cross-check was evaluated but stooq is behind a JavaScript/anti-bot wall from the agent sandbox (returns an HTML challenge, not CSV) for all tickers, so it is not a reliable second source here. Treat single-source as a known limitation rather than forcing an unreliable cross-check.

Conviction tiers:
- `HIGH`: >= -30% from 52w high (immediate alert if RISK_ON)
- `MEDIUM`: -25% to -30% (add to weekly pool)
- `WATCH`: -20% to -25% (note, don't alert)

## Decision logic after running

**Step 1: Check regime first.**
```bash
python3 .agents/skills/regime-detection/regime_monitor.py --json
```
If `regime = RISK_OFF`: no new buys. Still run screener to build watchlist for when regime recovers.

**Step 2: For each HIGH hit in RISK_ON regime → immediate DM:**
```
🚨 DIP ALERT — [TICKER] [pct]% below 52w high
  52w high: $[high_52w]  Now: $[price]  200dMA: $[sma] ([pct_vs_200d]% [above/below])
  Regime: RISK_ON (score [score])
  → Route to /multi-lens-quorum for verdict? Reply YES to run full analysis.
```

**Step 3: For MEDIUM hits → add to weekly candidate pool — DETERMINISTICALLY.**
Run with `--emit-pool` so the script itself appends HIGH+MEDIUM rows (no LLM in the loop):
```bash
python3 dip_screener.py --threshold 20 --emit-pool   # → ~/.openclaw/workspace/investor/pools/dip_candidates.jsonl
```
That durable path (NOT `/tmp` — openclaw cron sessions don't share `/tmp`) is read by
`signal-convergence-alert` at 08:30 UTC.

**Step 4: Cross-check with trend-stock-research.**
If a HIGH/MEDIUM ticker also appears in recent FT/WSJ coverage → CONVERGENCE signal. Elevate conviction.

## Success criteria

- [ ] Script ran and produced output (or confirmed no hits).
- [ ] Regime checked before any alert.
- [ ] HIGH hits in RISK_ON regime: DM sent immediately.
- [ ] MEDIUM hits: written to candidate pool.
- [ ] No alert sent for RISK_OFF regime (watchlist only).

## Schedule

Run **daily 07:45 UTC (Mon–Fri)** so alerts arrive before US market open (09:30 ET).
