# Analysis: The Crypto-Macro Lens (liquidity → dollar → cycle → ETF flows)

Apply the **macro lens** to interpret global liquidity conditions, the Fed balance sheet, the dollar, and the
halving cycle as *tailwinds or headwinds for BTC*. This is a **reading lens**, not a trade signal. Grounded
in **Michael J. Howell, *Capital Wars: The Rise of Global Liquidity* (Palgrave Macmillan, 2020)** for the
liquidity pillar, and in post-2024 ETF flow data for the institutional demand pillar. Depends on
**[[crypto-liquidity-data]]** for live numbers.

## The unifying worldview

BTC is the **highest-beta global liquidity sponge**. Howell's core insight: *"it is the capacity of capital
— more important than the cost of capital"* — meaning balance sheet expansion, not rate cuts, is what drives
risk assets. **Global liquidity leads equities by 6–12 months** and BTC by a similar or shorter lag. The DXY
is the denominator: a falling dollar inflates all dollar-denominated assets. The halving cycle compresses
supply issuance every ~4 years and historically marks the start of bull phases — but it works *through*
liquidity, not independently. ETF flows (since 2024) are the **dominant marginal demand signal**: institutional
buying via IBIT/FBTC creates a new structural demand floor that prior cycles lacked.

The honest analytical baseline: **macro direction is forecastable in direction, not in magnitude or timing.**
Output posture (TAILWIND / HEADWIND) and dominant risk — never a precise price target.

## Core mental models (the load-bearing ones)

1. **GLI direction is the governor.** Expanding GLI (Rebound/Calm Howell phases) = green light for BTC.
   Contracting (Turbulence/Post-peak) = headwind regardless of on-chain cheapness. The lead is *months*,
   so the GLI reads the environment ahead of price.
2. **Fed net liquidity = WALCL − RRP − TGA.** Rising = liquidity injection into the system; falling = drainage.
   This is more important than the rate *level* — a rate pause with active QT is still a headwind.
3. **DXY: dollar is the denominator.** Falling DXY = tailwind for BTC and commodities. DXY > 105 and rising =
   structural headwind. Watch for DXY trend change as an early macro signal.
4. **US M2 YoY: expansion with ~6mo lag.** M2 acceleration correlates with BTC appreciation approximately
   6 months later (Lyn Alden thesis). M2 contraction = watch for deferred headwind.
5. **Halving cycle position.** Apr 2024 halving = BTC is now ~14 months post-halving; historically peak comes
   12–18 months after halving (Q2–Q3 2025 window). Current position: mid-cycle. The halving reduces miner
   sell pressure but only matters if liquidity supports the move.
6. **ETF net flows (IBIT/FBTC/aggregate): 5-day direction is the institutional demand signal.** Sustained
   outflows = institutional distribution; sustained inflows = demand floor and potential squeeze. This signal
   did not exist before January 2024 — it is the single biggest structural change vs prior cycles.
7. **BTC–S&P correlation in risk-off.** When S&P sells off and DXY spikes simultaneously, BTC behaves like
   a risk asset, not a safe haven. Watch for de-correlation events as a potential macro narrative shift
   (BTC re-rated as digital gold).

## How to apply the lens (decision procedure)

1. **Fetch liquidity data via [[crypto-liquidity-data]].** Pull WALCL, RRP, TGA → compute Fed net liquidity
   direction. Pull GLI proxy or CrossBorder Capital phase if available.
2. **Get halving cycle position.** Apr 14, 2024 = halving date. Compute months elapsed → map to historical
   phase (pre-halving / early post-halving 0–6mo / mid-cycle 6–18mo / late-cycle 18–24mo).
3. **Fetch ETF flows.** WebFetch `farside.co.uk/btc/` or CoinGlass aggregate ETF flow table.
   Compute 5-day net and trailing 30-day net. Classify regime: ACCUMULATION / NEUTRAL / DISTRIBUTION.
4. **Classify Howell cycle phase.** Using GLI direction + rate environment: **Rebound** (liquidity rising from
   trough) / **Calm** (expanding, below-trend) / **Speculation** (above-trend, momentum) / **Turbulence**
   (peak + rolling over). Rebound and Calm = constructive; Speculation = late-but-running; Turbulence = exit.
5. **Score each macro pillar:**
   - GLI / Fed net liquidity: EXPANDING / FLAT / CONTRACTING
   - DXY: FALLING / FLAT / RISING (with level vs 100/105 anchors)
   - M2 YoY: ACCELERATING / FLAT / DECELERATING
   - Halving cycle: EARLY / MID / LATE (months elapsed)
   - ETF regime: ACCUMULATION / NEUTRAL / DISTRIBUTION
6. **Derive macro posture.** Aggregate pillar scores into:
   **STRONG TAILWIND / TAILWIND / NEUTRAL / HEADWIND / STRONG HEADWIND**
7. **State the dominant risk.** Name the single macro factor most threatening the constructive thesis
   (e.g., "Fed restarting QT while RRP refills" or "DXY breakout above 107" or "ETF 30-day outflow streak").

## Routing table

| Question is about… | Action |
|---|---|
| GLI, Howell phases, liquidity leading equities, "is liquidity expanding" | Fetch [[crypto-liquidity-data]], classify Howell phase |
| Fed balance sheet, QT/QE, WALCL, RRP, TGA, "Fed net liquidity" | Fetch WALCL−RRP−TGA via [[crypto-liquidity-data]] |
| DXY, dollar strength, "DXY and BTC", dollar milkshake | Pull DXY level + trend; score vs 100/105 anchors |
| M2 money supply, "is money printing bullish", Lyn Alden debasement thesis | Pull US M2 YoY; note ~6mo lag |
| Halving cycle, "where are we in the cycle", supply issuance | Compute months since Apr 14 2024 halving |
| ETF flows, IBIT, FBTC, institutional demand, "are ETFs buying" | WebFetch farside.co.uk/btc/ or CoinGlass |
| BTC–S&P correlation, risk-off, "is BTC a safe haven" | Note correlation regime; flag de-correlation watch |

All metrics must include `asof` date. If a live fetch fails, state `[STALE — manual refresh needed]`.
Do not output buy/sell signals or price targets.

## Citation rule — no URL = not a source

Every external claim (news event, data point, quote, analysis) MUST include ALL THREE:
1. **Full URL** fetched: `https://exact-page-url` (specific article, not homepage or search page)
2. **Date** (ISO): `YYYY-MM-DD` (publication or as-of date)
3. **Verbatim quote**: exact words from the page, copied not paraphrased

Format in output: `[TIER] https://exact-url (YYYY-MM-DD) — "verbatim quote"`

**Never write:**
- Source name alone (`CoinDesk`, `Bloomberg`) — without URL it is hallucination bait
- A quote without its URL
- A URL without a date
- Anything paraphrased from memory without a prior web_fetch call

**If fetch failed:** `[FETCH FAILED: https://...] — not counted toward minimum`
**If < 2 real sources:** output `INSUFFICIENT_DATA — do not guess`

## Done when

The analysis (1) classifies the **Howell liquidity phase** from live data, (2) scores each **macro pillar**
with a direction tag and recency date, (3) classifies the **ETF flow regime** from the latest 5-day net,
(4) states the **halving cycle position** in months, (5) derives a single **macro posture** label, and
(6) names the **dominant risk** threatening the thesis. All metrics sourced from [[crypto-liquidity-data]]
or WebFetch with explicit `asof` dates — no stale or recalled numbers.
