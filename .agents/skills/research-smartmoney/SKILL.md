# Analyst: Smart Money (disclosed flows + market-implied → synthesized verdict)

This skill is the **conductor lens** of the smart-money family. It does **not** fetch raw data. It **routes** to the eight specialist spoke skills, **collects** each spoke's per-signal verdict, and **synthesizes** one actionable read per asset. The synthesis logic is explicit: signals are reliability-weighted, cross-class confirmation is required, and when signals conflict the default is NEUTRAL rather than a forced call.

## The unifying worldview (everything connects to this)

**Smart money is what informed players DO, not what they say.** The worldview splits into two independent windows onto informed capital:

**Disclosed flows** follow real money through regulatory filings — these are binding, legally reported transactions with known lags. Form 4 insider buys (2-day lag) are the fastest and highest-conviction real-money signal in public markets; 13F institutional clustering (45-day lag) reveals the long-only consensus of the largest allocators; 13D/13G activist filings (near-real-time) reveal concentrated positions with explicit change-of-control intent; congressional PTR filings (30–45-day lag) reveal elected officials' trades but carry contested alpha post-STOCK Act.

**Market-implied signals** reveal what informed money *prices* through positioning and order flow — but these are **risk-neutral probability estimates**, not real-world odds or directional bets. COT commercial positioning in commodities reflects the hedging behavior of the best-informed industry participants; dark-pool DIX (counterintuitively: high DIX = institutional buying, not selling, because market makers short to hedge institutional buys); single-name options sweeps reveal urgency-driven directional bets; prediction-market event odds embed the market's consensus probability on specific dated catalysts.

The unifying discipline is **cross-class confirmation**: five options prints agreeing = ONE signal from ONE class, not five confirmations. A Form 4 cluster buy plus 13F accumulation plus COT extreme = THREE independent mechanisms pointing the same direction — that is real confirmation. **Hedge-as-signal is the dominant failure mode**: a 13F put, a block print, a market-maker short, or a put sweep may be one leg of a hedge whose offsetting position is invisible. Always ask: *what position can't I see?*

## Core mental models (the load-bearing ones)

1. **Real-money / low-lag hierarchy.** The reliability of a signal scales with (a) whether it represents real capital at risk and (b) how close in time it is to the observation. Form 4 cluster buys are the fastest real-money feed (2-day lag). 13D filings are near-real-time for large activist stakes. 13F is 45-day lagged long-only. PTR is 30–45 days lagged and alpha is contested. → `references/01-disclosed-flows.md`

2. **COT commercials = the smart side in commodities.** CFTC Commitments of Traders: commercials hedge physical exposure and are informed about supply/demand; normalize the net position 0–100 over a 3-year lookback (Stephen Briese's method); readings at extremes (>90 or <10) are the contrarian signal, not the trend. COT does **not** translate cleanly to equity futures, where commercials are often index-rebalancers. → `references/02-market-implied.md`

3. **DIX is a dark-pool accumulation signal, not a selling signal.** High DIX means market makers are shorting to hedge large institutional buy flow — **bullish** for equities, counterintuitively. It is an index-level signal only (SqueezeMetrics data product). → `references/02-market-implied.md`

4. **Options flow: aggregate ratio > single prints.** The Pan-Poteshman (2006) finding is that the **aggregate put/call volume ratio** is a more reliable edge than individual unusual prints. Single sweeps are real-time but low signal-to-noise; classify them as urgency (sweep) vs. hedge-likely (block) before reading direction. → `references/02-market-implied.md`

5. **Wyckoff structure confirms after the fact, not before.** The Composite Operator is a useful mental model for reading price-volume sequences in a base (Accumulation phases A→E) or a top (Distribution phases A→E). The spring and upthrust are the key events. But Wyckoff is discretionary and interpretive — it belongs in the synthesis only as confirmatory context, never as a primary trigger. → `references/03-wyckoff-accumulation-distribution.md`

6. **Prediction markets are risk-neutral odds.** A Polymarket contract at 70% does **not** mean there is a 70% real-world probability of the event — it is a risk-neutral price that embeds a volatility risk premium. Haircut all prediction-market readings before treating them as base-case probabilities. → `references/02-market-implied.md`

7. **Confirmation across mechanisms beats depth in one class.** The synthesis rule is strict: independent signal *classes* (disclosed vs. implied) confirming each other is worth more than multiple feeds from the same class. A 13F cluster buy and a Form 4 cluster buy are two classes; five options sweep prints are one class. → `references/04-synthesis-and-failure-modes.md`

## How to apply the lens (decision procedure)

1. **Identify the asset class and question type.** Determine whether the question concerns a US-listed equity (all 8 spokes potentially relevant), a commodity (COT is the primary market-implied spoke), or a macro event (PTR and Polymarket most relevant). Spoke relevance varies by asset class — do not force an irrelevant spoke into the synthesis.

2. **Route to each relevant spoke and collect per-signal verdicts.** For a US equity, the full spoke sequence is: `analyst-smartmoney-form4` → `analyst-smartmoney-13f` → `analyst-smartmoney-13d` → `analyst-smartmoney-ptr` → `analyst-smartmoney-positioning` → `analyst-smartmoney-options` → `analyst-smartmoney-darkpool` → `analyst-smartmoney-polymarket`. Each spoke returns one verdict: **ACC** (accumulating / bullish) / **DIST** (distributing / bearish) / **NEUTRAL** / **UNAVAIL** (data not available or not applicable).

3. **Apply reliability weighting.** Weight verdicts in descending reliability order: Form 4 cluster buys (real money, 2-day lag) > 13F/13D institutional clustering (real money, 45-day / near-real-time) > COT extremes in commodities (3-day lag, best-informed hedgers) > DIX/dark-pool tilt (delayed, index-level only) > Wyckoff structure (discretionary, after-the-fact) > options flow (real-time but low signal-to-noise) > congressional PTR (45-day lag, alpha contested post-STOCK Act). A high-reliability ACC verdict outweighs two low-reliability DIST verdicts in the synthesis.

4. **Require cross-class confirmation.** Count how many **independent signal classes** agree — disclosed flows (Form 4 + 13F + 13D + PTR as one class) vs. market-implied (positioning + options + dark pool + polymarket as one class). Require at least two independent classes pointing the same direction before emitting ACC or DIST with MED or HIGH conviction. One class agreeing → LOW conviction. Zero classes in agreement or active conflict → NEUTRAL.

5. **Check for the hedge-as-signal failure mode before finalizing.** For every market-implied signal reading ACC or DIST, ask: *could this be one leg of a hedge whose offsetting position I cannot see?* A large put position in a 13F may be a protective put against a long equity book. A block on the options tape may be a market maker hedging a client's opposite position. If the hedge interpretation is plausible, downgrade conviction one notch.

6. **Emit the structured verdict.** Follow the output contract below exactly. State the invalidation condition — the specific signal flip that would reverse the verdict. Always include the NOTE line.

## Output contract

Every call to this skill must produce the following structured block, verbatim in structure:

```
SMART-MONEY READ: <TICKER>  (as-of <date>)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DISCLOSED FLOWS                        MARKET-IMPLIED
  Form 4  [ACC/DIST/NEUTRAL/UNAVAIL]    Positioning [ACC/DIST/NEUTRAL/UNAVAIL]
  13F     [ACC/DIST/NEUTRAL/UNAVAIL]    Options     [ACC/DIST/NEUTRAL/UNAVAIL]
  13D     [ACC/DIST/NEUTRAL/UNAVAIL]    Dark pool   [ACC/DIST/NEUTRAL/UNAVAIL]
  PTR     [ACC/DIST/NEUTRAL/UNAVAIL]    Polymarket  [ACC/DIST/NEUTRAL/UNAVAIL]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VERDICT:      [ACCUMULATING / DISTRIBUTING / NEUTRAL]
CONVICTION:   [HIGH / MED / LOW]
CONFIRMATION: [N independent signal classes agreeing — e.g., "2 of 2: disclosed + implied both ACC"]
INVALIDATION: [specific signal flip that changes the verdict — e.g., "Form 4 cluster sell or 13F net reduction >20% flips to DIST"]
NOTE: Educational only. Lag / crowding / hedge-as-signal caveats apply. Re-pull spoke data before acting.
```

**Conviction rules:** HIGH = ≥3 signal classes aligned including at least one high-reliability spoke; MED = 2 classes aligned; LOW = 1 class aligned or primary signals conflict; NEUTRAL = no directional signal or active conflict.

## Example

<example>
User: "What is the smart-money read on NVDA?"

<thinking>
NVDA is a large-cap US equity — all eight spokes are potentially relevant. Route each spoke, collect verdicts, then synthesize.
</thinking>

Route through all eight spokes and collect their verdicts (illustrative readings — re-pull all live data before acting):

- **Form 4** (`analyst-smartmoney-form4`): Three independent director/officer purchases clustered in the past 30 days, $2M–$8M each, open-market buys. → **ACC** (HIGH reliability: cluster buys, real money, 2-day lag)
- **13F** (`analyst-smartmoney-13f`): Latest 13F filings (45-day lag) show net institutional accumulation — 14 large funds increased positions, 6 reduced. Sector rotation into AI semis visible across multiple filers. → **ACC** (HIGH reliability: real money, but 45d lag means this may describe a prior quarter)
- **13D** (`analyst-smartmoney-13d`): No Schedule 13D/13G activist filing for NVDA (market-cap too large for most activists). → **UNAVAIL**
- **PTR** (`analyst-smartmoney-ptr`): No recent congressional PTR disclosures for NVDA in the past 60 days. → **UNAVAIL**
- **Positioning** (`analyst-smartmoney-positioning`): NVDA options skew slightly call-heavy; 30-day IV relatively compressed; gamma neutral near current price; no COT relevance (equity, not commodity). → **NEUTRAL**
- **Options** (`analyst-smartmoney-options`): Two large call sweeps in the past week (upside strikes, aggressive fills), but also a large protective put block — block is likely a hedge against the long. Net: one clean directional sweep vs. one hedge-likely block. → **NEUTRAL** (hedge-as-signal flag raised on the put block)
- **Dark pool** (`analyst-smartmoney-darkpool`): DIX elevated above 45% for three consecutive days — historically bullish at index level. NVDA-specific block prints above average. → **ACC** (MED reliability: index-level indicator, NVDA block prints are directional color only)
- **Polymarket** (`analyst-smartmoney-polymarket`): No active NVDA-specific contract; macro contracts (Fed pause odds at 74%) marginally supportive of risk assets. → **NEUTRAL**

**Synthesis:**
- Disclosed class: Form 4 ACC + 13F ACC = **disclosed flows pointing ACC** (two high-reliability real-money signals)
- Implied class: Dark pool ACC, Positioning NEUTRAL, Options NEUTRAL (hedge flag raised) = **implied signals mixed, lean ACC**
- Cross-class: Both classes lean ACC — confirmed across independent mechanisms
- Hedge-as-signal check: Put block on options tape downgraded to NEUTRAL; does not contaminate the Form 4 / 13F read

```
SMART-MONEY READ: NVDA  (as-of 2026-06-26)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DISCLOSED FLOWS                        MARKET-IMPLIED
  Form 4  [ACC]                          Positioning [NEUTRAL]
  13F     [ACC]                          Options     [NEUTRAL]
  13D     [UNAVAIL]                      Dark pool   [ACC]
  PTR     [UNAVAIL]                      Polymarket  [NEUTRAL]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VERDICT:      ACCUMULATING
CONVICTION:   MED
CONFIRMATION: 2 of 2 available classes — disclosed (Form 4 + 13F) and implied (dark pool) both ACC; options neutral after hedge-as-signal flag
INVALIDATION: Form 4 cluster sell by same officers, or 13F net reduction >20% next filing cycle, flips verdict to DIST
NOTE: Educational only. Lag / crowding / hedge-as-signal caveats apply. 13F data is 45 days stale. Re-pull spoke data before acting.
```
</example>

## Honesty rules (non-negotiable)

- **Output verdicts with explicit confidence, never certainty.** ACCUMULATING / DISTRIBUTING / NEUTRAL are analytical weights, not buy/sell instructions. Every verdict degrades as data ages.

- **Six failure modes — always check before finalizing:**
  1. **Lag.** 13F and PTR describe portfolios that may have been partially or fully unwound since the filing date. A 13F showing accumulation 45 days ago is a historical fact, not a current position.
  2. **Crowding.** Public guru trackers and congressional disclosure aggregators are widely arbitraged. Cloning a famous 13F or a senator's trade is consensus at best — the edge has likely been front-run by the time a retail-accessible signal fires.
  3. **Hedge-as-signal — the dominant failure mode.** A 13F put position, a large block on the tape, a market-maker short, or a put sweep may be one leg of a hedge whose offsetting position is invisible in the data. Always ask: *what position can't I see?* Never read a single leg as a clean directional bet.
  4. **False confidence from correlated signals.** Five options sweep prints from the same OPRA tape on the same day are ONE signal from ONE class, not five independent confirmations. Only count independent mechanisms.
  5. **Survivorship in vendor marketing.** Options flow vendors, dark-pool data services, and 13F clone products all market on their best backtested examples. Demand out-of-sample evidence. Najarian's options flow book is promotional with weak false-positive disclosure. The "retail 8–11% per insider cluster buy" figure is UNSOURCED — do not assert it.
  6. **Regime-dependence.** Congressional alpha was documented pre-STOCK Act (Ziobrowski +6–12%/yr pre-2008), but post-STOCK Act studies (Eggers-Hainmueller 2013, Chen-Sacerdote NBER 2024) find congressional trades resemble uninformed retail — edge now concentrated in leadership only, if at all. COT works in commodities; the commercial-as-smart-money logic does not apply cleanly to equity-index futures.

- **Ground load-bearing numbers in `references/book-index.md`.** Do not cite a figure without tracing it to a specific source. If a source is flagged CONTESTED or FLAG in the book index, say so explicitly in the output.

- **On conflict between signal classes, default to NEUTRAL.** Do not force a verdict by cherry-picking the highest-reliability signal that supports a directional read. A genuine conflict between disclosed (ACC) and implied (DIST) from different mechanisms is information — it means the smart-money signal is ambiguous, and NEUTRAL is the correct output.

- **Educational only.** This skill produces analytical outputs for research and learning. It is not financial advice. No verdict from this skill constitutes a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security.

## Done when

The analysis (1) routes to every **relevant spoke** for the asset class and collects a verdict from each, (2) applies the **reliability weighting** (Form 4 cluster buys > 13F/13D > COT extremes > DIX > Wyckoff > options flow > PTR), (3) requires **cross-class confirmation** across at least two independent signal mechanisms before emitting ACC or DIST, (4) checks the **hedge-as-signal failure mode** on every market-implied ACC or DIST verdict, (5) emits the **structured output contract** verbatim, and (6) states a clear **invalidation condition** and the educational NOTE.
