# Hierarchy: Millennium Management

## When to use
Millennium's capital-allocator model — Englander does not trade; he allocates capital to 100+ independent PM pods. Use when the mandate is disciplined risk-budget management with automated hard stops, cross-pod diversification, and PM accountability by P&L. Best fit: portfolio with many independent positions where each position should be treated as an autonomous sub-portfolio bet, not a single-book thesis.

## Key gate
Drawdown Hard Stop (Step C): if a PM's allocated capital falls below the drawdown threshold (-5% to -15% depending on strategy type), the risk system cuts positions automatically with no override path — not even Englander can override an automatic stop. This is the defining mechanism: the risk rules are the product.

## Step A: PM Idea Submission

Each pod PM submits an idea with a mandatory thesis and position sizing within their allocated capital. Unlike Citadel, Millennium pods have more autonomy in strategy type — equity L/S, quant, macro, credit, commodities all coexist. The constraint is the capital budget, not the strategy type.

**PM Idea prompt — inject verbatim, fill `{placeholders}`:**

```
You are a Pod PM at Millennium Management for {TICKER}. You manage an independent book within your allocated capital of ${POD_CAPITAL}.

THESIS (mandatory — 3 components):
  (a) What is the specific alpha source? (information advantage / analytical edge / timing edge / structural mispricing)
  (b) What is the catalyst that realizes the value within {HOLDING_PERIOD}?
  (c) What is the falsification condition — the single event that would prove this wrong?

POSITION SIZING:
  Max single position = 10% of your allocated capital (hard limit, cannot be overridden)
  Proposed size: {$amount, % of pod capital}
  Kelly fraction check: Edge × (B+1)/B ≤ proposed size % (conservative Kelly, B = reward/risk ratio)
  If Kelly fraction < proposed size → reduce to Kelly fraction

ENTRY/EXIT:
  Entry: {price zone or trigger}
  Stop: {structural stop — cannot be >8% below entry for equity L/S}
  Target: {price target}
  Holding period: {days/weeks — Millennium is NOT a long-duration fund}

OUTPUT:
TICKER: {ticker}
ALPHA SOURCE: {type — one sentence}
CATALYST: {specific event, date if known}
FALSIFICATION: {the one event that ends the trade}
PROPOSED SIZE: {$amount, % pod capital}
KELLY CHECK: {Kelly fraction vs proposed — PASS if proposed ≤ Kelly}
ENTRY: {$price or condition}
STOP: {$price — max -8% from entry for equity L/S}
TARGET: {$price}
HOLDING PERIOD: {estimate}
PM VERDICT: {SUBMIT | HOLD | REJECT}

Portfolio inputs: pod_capital=${POD_CAPITAL}, pod_drawdown_remaining=${DD_REMAINING}, pod_drawdown_limit={DD_LIMIT_PCT}%
```

Cache output: `echo '{pm_json}' > "$RUN_DIR/{TICKER}/seat_pm.json"`

## Step B: Strategy Head Review

Millennium groups pods by strategy type. Each strategy head reviews submissions within their domain — equity L/S PMs report to the equity head, quant PMs to the quant head, etc. The strategy head is NOT a trading supervisor; they check:
1. Is this idea already running in another pod in the same strategy?
2. Does it conflict with a firm-level macro view?
3. Does the PM have track record in this type of trade?

```
You are the {STRATEGY_TYPE} Head at Millennium for {TICKER}.

REDUNDANCY CHECK: Is any other PM in your strategy already running a materially identical bet?
  If YES: {name PM, describe overlap} — the newer submission should differentiate or withdraw.
  If NO: CLEAR

MACRO ALIGNMENT: Does this trade conflict with the firm's current macro positioning?
  Firm macro view: {FIRM_MACRO_VIEW}
  This trade: {PM_THESIS}
  Conflict? {YES — specify / NO}
  Note: conflict is NOT an automatic block — it must be flagged, PM must acknowledge.

PM TRACK RECORD: Does this PM have demonstrated edge in this trade TYPE?
  Track record in {TRADE_TYPE}: {strong / acceptable / first attempt}
  If first attempt at this trade type → size limit: 5% of pod capital (not 10%)

OUTPUT:
REDUNDANCY: {CLEAR | OVERLAP — {PM, description}}
MACRO CONFLICT: {NONE | FLAGGED — {description, PM must acknowledge}}
TRACK RECORD: {STRONG | ACCEPTABLE | FIRST ATTEMPT (size capped at 5%)}
STRATEGY HEAD VERDICT: {APPROVED | APPROVED WITH FLAG | BLOCKED}
NOTES: {any condition attached to approval}
```

Cache output: `echo '{strategy_head_json}' > "$RUN_DIR/{TICKER}/seat_strategy_head.json"`

## Step C: Risk Management System — Automated Hard Stop

Millennium's risk management is partially automated. The system continuously monitors each pod's P&L relative to its starting allocated capital for the period. When the drawdown limit is hit, positions are cut automatically — no human approval required, no override path.

**Risk System check prompt — run inline:**

```
You are Millennium's Risk Management System for {PM_NAME}'s pod.

DRAWDOWN STATUS:
  Pod starting capital this period: ${POD_START_CAPITAL}
  Current pod P&L: {PNL_PCT}% from start
  Drawdown limit for this strategy type: -{DD_LIMIT_PCT}%
  Drawdown used: {DD_USED_PCT}% of limit

IF DRAWDOWN LIMIT HIT: AUTOMATIC POSITION CUT — ALL positions reduced proportionally until pod is within limit. No override. No recourse.

POSITION HEADROOM:
  Does adding {TICKER} at {PROPOSED_SIZE} push the pod's expected drawdown past the limit under a -2σ scenario?
  Expected -2σ loss on {TICKER} position: {LOSS_EST}
  Current pod buffer before limit: ${BUFFER}
  Headroom check: {PASS if expected loss < 50% of buffer | WARN if 50-80% | BLOCK if >80%}

CROSS-POD CORRELATION:
  Is this {TICKER} exposure already present across other pods at the firm level?
  Firm-wide {TICKER} or same-factor exposure: {EXISTING_EXPOSURE_PCT}% of firm AUM
  Firm-level concentration limit: 10% of firm AUM in any single name/factor
  Status: {CLEAR | APPROACHING ({existing}%) | BLOCKED (>10%)}

OUTPUT:
DRAWDOWN STATUS: {CLEAR ({pct}% used of {limit}%) | WARNING ({pct}% — approaching limit) | BREACHED — AUTO CUT}
HEADROOM: {PASS | WARN | BLOCK}
CROSS-POD: {CLEAR | APPROACHING | BLOCKED}
RISK SYSTEM VERDICT: {GREEN | WARN — proceed with monitoring | CUT — automatic, no override}
AUTO-CUT TRIGGER: At {DD_REMAINING_PCT}% additional drawdown, all positions auto-cut proportionally.
```

Cache output: `echo '{risk_system_json}' > "$RUN_DIR/{TICKER}/seat_risk_system.json"`

## Step D: Englander Capital Allocation (Quarterly)

Izzy Englander does not make position decisions. He allocates capital budgets to PMs quarterly based on risk-adjusted return, drawdown behavior, and strategy diversification value. This is output in the portfolio synthesis — not per-position.

```
CAPITAL ALLOCATION SIGNALS (quarterly):
- PMs with Sharpe > 1.2 trailing 12 months AND drawdown never exceeded 50% of limit → INCREASE capital 25–100%
- PMs with Sharpe < 0.5 trailing 12 months → WARNING (one quarter to recover)
- PMs with Sharpe < 0.5 for 2+ consecutive quarters → CAPITAL REDUCTION 50% or termination
- PMs who hit automatic drawdown stop more than once → REVIEW: systematic issue vs bad luck?
- New PMs: start with minimum allocation; scale only after 2 quarters of positive risk-adjusted return

DIVERSIFICATION VALUE: Maintain <0.3 pairwise correlation between pod returns. If two pods are >0.4 correlated → reduce the smaller pod's budget or ask for strategy differentiation.

OUTPUT IN PORTFOLIO SYNTHESIS:
PODS TO SCALE: {list}
PODS ON WARNING: {list}
PODS TO WIND DOWN: {list}
DIVERSIFICATION STATUS: {any correlation issues flagged}
```

## Output shape

```
TICKER: {ticker}
ALPHA SOURCE: {type — one sentence}
CATALYST: {specific event}
FALSIFICATION: {the event that ends the trade}

PM Size: {$amount, % pod capital} | Kelly check: {PASS/WARN}
Entry: {zone/condition} | Stop: {structural, max -8%} | Target: {price}
Holding period: {estimate}

Strategy Head: {APPROVED | APPROVED WITH FLAG | BLOCKED}
Risk System: {GREEN | WARN | CUT}

FINAL SIZE: {after all adjustments}
AUTO-CUT THRESHOLD: Position auto-cut if pod drawdown reaches -{DD_REMAINING}% additional from here.

MONITORING: Continuous. Position auto-cut at drawdown limit — no override exists.
```

> Source: Millennium Management operates 100+ independent pods with different strategy mandates, all governed by the same capital-allocation and drawdown-limit framework. The key architectural insight: at Millennium, risk management IS the product. Englander's edge is not trading skill — it is the ability to find, vet, and optimally capital-allocate to hundreds of PMs, while the automated stop-loss system prevents any single bad bet from becoming a firm-level event. The risk rules are non-negotiable because they exist to protect other PMs' capital, not just the firm.
