# FOMC Monitor

Fetch the official FOMC calendar, most recent statement/minutes, and parse the hawkish/dovish tone shift vs the prior statement. Output a structured signal for the rest of the pipeline.

## Primary sources (always use official gov sources first)

```
Calendar:    https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm
Statements:  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm   (filter: monetary policy)
Minutes:     https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes.htm
Chair press: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech.htm           (Powell speeches)
CME FedWatch (market-implied): via prediction-market-odds skill
```

## Output contract

Every run MUST produce a structured block:

```
FOMC SIGNAL — <date>
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Next meeting:     <date(s)>
Current rate:     <Fed Funds target range>
Priced next move: <from prediction-market-odds / CME FedWatch>
Tone:             HAWKISH / NEUTRAL / DOVISH  (vs prior statement)
Tone delta:       +2 / 0 / -1  (directional shift, += more hawkish)
Key language:     "<exact quote from statement that moved the needle>"
Changed from:     "<prior statement equivalent phrase>"
Risk-asset signal: RISK_ON / NEUTRAL / RISK_OFF
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary (2-3 sentences): what the Fed said, what changed, and what it means for equities/rates.
```

## Procedure

1. **Fetch calendar** — get the next scheduled FOMC meeting date(s). Flag if we are within 10 days of a meeting (heightened sensitivity).

2. **Fetch latest statement** — exact 3-hop procedure:
   ```
   HOP 1: WebFetch https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm
           Find href: /newsevents/pressreleases/2026-press-fomc.htm  (or current year)

   HOP 2: WebFetch https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/2026-press-fomc.htm
           Find the FIRST href matching pattern: /newsevents/pressreleases/monetary2026*.htm
           (e.g. /newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20260429a.htm = April 29, 2026 meeting)

   HOP 3: WebFetch https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20260429a.htm
           THIS is the actual FOMC statement. Read it fully.
           Extract: rate decision, key policy paragraphs, vote tally, any guidance language.
   ```
   Do NOT stop at hop 1 or hop 2. You MUST fetch hop 3 to read the actual policy language.

3. **Fetch prior statement** — the SECOND monetary*.htm link from hop 2's page. Same 3-hop procedure but take link #2.

4. **Parse tone delta** — compare key policy language:
   - Count hawkish phrases: "remains committed to returning inflation", "still elevated", "further increases may be appropriate", "restrictive", "ongoing increases"
   - Count dovish phrases: "data-dependent", "appropriate to slow", "pause", "balanced", "well-anchored expectations", "easing", "rate cuts"
   - Note any changes in the description of the labor market, inflation trajectory, and balance-sheet policy.

5. **Pull market-implied path** — invoke `prediction-market-odds` skill for CME FedWatch probabilities for the next 2 meetings.

6. **Emit the structured signal** above. Route to `macro-panel` as the "Fed" input.

## Hawkish / Dovish keyword reference

**Hawkish signals:** "elevated inflation", "remains committed", "further firming", "restrictive for longer", "above target", "labor market remains tight", "wage growth elevated", "ongoing increases"

**Dovish signals:** "inflation has eased", "below 2%", "appropriate to hold", "well-anchored", "moderating", "labor market cooling", "rate cuts", "balance sheet reduction pace to slow"

**Neutral:** "data-dependent", "meeting-by-meeting", "monitoring developments"

## Schedule recommendation

- **Run daily at 08:00 UTC** — on non-meeting days, a 60-second fetch confirms nothing changed. On meeting days (typically 2pm ET), re-run at 19:00 UTC after the statement drops.
- Flag meeting days on the calendar check so the agent knows to re-run.

## Minutes vs Statement

The **Statement** is released the day of the meeting — the primary signal. The **Minutes** are released ~3 weeks later and contain deliberation details (useful for superforecasting the *next* move). Read both; weight the statement more heavily for near-term signals.

## Integration

- Feed output to `macro-panel` as the "Fed" chair position
- Feed rate-path probability to `superforecasting` as the market-implied anchor
- If Tone = HAWKISH and Tone delta ≥ +2: set regime input toward RISK_OFF (tighter financial conditions)
- If Tone = DOVISH and Tone delta ≤ -2: set regime input toward RISK_ON (easing supports equities)
