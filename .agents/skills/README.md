# Skills — Agentic Investment Portfolio Manager

opencode-compatible `SKILL.md` modules for an automated, agent-driven investment portfolio.
Each is self-contained with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility: opencode`).

**All skills are educational frameworks, not personalized financial advice.**

## Quick Install (any AI agent)

One command installs the full skill set from `dzianisv/backtest`:

```bash
# Claude Code
npx -y skills add dzianisv/backtest --agent claude-code

# opencode
npx -y skills add dzianisv/backtest --agent opencode

# hermes-agent
npx -y skills add dzianisv/backtest --agent hermes-agent

# openclaw  (with script files — required for watch.py / ledger.py)
npx --yes skills add dzianisv/backtest \
  --agent openclaw --yes --copy --dangerously-accept-openclaw-risks
```

Or install individual skills by adding `--skill <name>`:
```bash
npx -y skills add dzianisv/backtest --skill 13f-watch --agent claude-code
npx -y skills add dzianisv/backtest --skill congressman-stock-watch --agent opencode
```

> The `skills` npm package (v1.5+) supports all agents above. If `npx` isn't available, install once:
> `npm install -g skills`

### hermes-agent (alternative: URL install)

```bash
# Install individual skills by raw URL
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzianisv/backtest/main/.agents/skills/13f-watch/SKILL.md
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzianisv/backtest/main/.agents/skills/congressman-stock-watch/SKILL.md
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzianisv/backtest/main/.agents/skills/trend-stock-research/SKILL.md
hermes skills install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzianisv/backtest/main/.agents/skills/hedge-fund-manager/SKILL.md
```

### Setup prompt (all agents)

After installing, paste **[INVESTOR-SETUP-PROMPT.md](INVESTOR-SETUP-PROMPT.md)** to your agent — works on openclaw, hermes-agent, Claude Code, opencode, or any agent with the skills loaded.

The prompt tells the agent to:
1. Verify all skills loaded
2. Run 13F + congressional + trending stock research immediately
3. Register 4 recurring cron jobs (daily regime, weekly 13F, weekly congress, weekly trend research)

## The watchlist pipeline

```
13f-watch (institutional filings, weekly)
    +
congressman-stock-watch (STOCK Act disclosures, weekly)
    ↓
multi-lens-quorum (judge: should I buy this?)
    ↓
superforecasting (when + probability)
    ↓
trend-stock-research (weekly — reads journalism, surfaces narratives)
```

`hedge-fund-manager` orchestrates the daily loop. `agentic-fund-orchestration` wires it all together.
