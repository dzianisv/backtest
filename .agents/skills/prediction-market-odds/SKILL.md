# Prediction-Market Odds (the crowd's priced probability)

## HARD TRIGGER — read this first (added after a real miss)

The instant you are about to **state a probability for a dated, observable outcome** (FOMC hold/cut/hike,
CPI print, election, ETF ruling, "BTC ≤$X by [date]"), you MUST pull it with this skill — **before** you
type the number. This fires even mid-analysis: if a sentence you're writing contains "% odds", "priced",
"~X% chance", "markets expect" about such an outcome, STOP and run the recipe below.

**Anti-pattern that bit us (2026-06-15):** quoting FOMC odds from a WebSearch *summary* / news blurb
(IndexBox digest). Result: "93% hold" (real: 99.45%) and "70% hike by Dec" (real: ~32% — the digest had
it **backwards**). News digests paraphrase and invert market numbers. A WebSearch result is NEVER an
acceptable source for a priced probability — it's a pointer to *go pull the market*. If you find yourself
citing a number you did not get from `gamma-api.polymarket.com` / Kalshi / FedWatch this turn, you have
already failed; delete the number and run the recipe.

If the skill isn't in your surfaced list, it's still on disk — `grep -ril polymarket .agents/skills/` and
read it. Don't skip it because it wasn't pre-loaded.

A prediction market price **is** an implied probability — thousands of betting wallets aggregating
dispersed information (Hayek; Hanson; Wolfers & Zitzewitz). For any **dated, observable** outcome it beats
your own guess. This skill = the HOW: find the market, read the odds, weight by liquidity, dodge the traps.

## When to use vs not

**Use when** the question has a **dated + observable resolution** a market would price: FOMC/rate
decisions, CPI/PCE prints, elections, token unlocks, ETF approvals, "BTC ≤$X by [date]".

**Do NOT use when** there's no tradeable resolution (vague "is crypto healthy"), or the question is a
fact/definition. No market = no anchor; don't fabricate one.

## Venue menu (pull the relevant one; corroborate across ≥2 when liquid)

| Venue | Best for | Access |
|---|---|---|
| **Polymarket** | Crypto prices, macro, politics, general — deepest crypto | Gamma API (below), no key |
| **Kalshi** | Regulated US econ — CPI, Fed, jobs, GDP (often deeper than PM on prints) | `api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2` (public read) |
| **CME FedWatch** | Fed-funds path from futures (not a bet market, but the rate-path benchmark) | cmegroup.com (JS-rendered — use search/snippet) |

## Polymarket Gamma API — the working recipe

**Discovery = `public-search`. Do NOT guess slugs, do NOT browse `/markets` list** (the list returns thousands of unfiltered markets including novelty/entertainment — always search):

For **macro markets** relevant to equities, run these searches (one WebFetch per query):
```
WebFetch: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/public-search?q=fed+rate+decision&limit_per_type=5
WebFetch: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/public-search?q=federal+reserve+2026&limit_per_type=5
WebFetch: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/public-search?q=recession+2026&limit_per_type=5
WebFetch: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/public-search?q=S%26P+500&limit_per_type=5
WebFetch: https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/public-search?q=CPI+inflation&limit_per_type=5
```

Filter results: KEEP only markets where the `question` or `title` contains at least one of:
  `Fed`, `FOMC`, `rate`, `recession`, `CPI`, `inflation`, `GDP`, `S&P`, `cut`, `hike`, `basis point`
DISCARD any market about sports, entertainment, gaming (GTA, elections unrelated to economy), celebrities.

Then for each relevant market slug:
```bash
# FETCH the event's markets + odds by slug
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=<slug-from-search>"
#    each market has: outcomes, outcomePrices (stringified arrays), volume, liquidity, endDate
```

Read it: `outcomePrices[0]` = implied P(Yes) (e.g. `"0.9905"` = 99.05%). For a grouped event (Fed
decision = many brackets), iterate the sub-markets; each bracket's Yes price is its probability. The
`/markets?closed=false` *list* endpoint is unfiltered junk — never browse it for discovery, always
`public-search`.

## Weight by liquidity — signal vs noise

A price is only as good as the money behind it. Read `volume` + `liquidity` on every market:

| Liquidity / volume | Treat as |
|---|---|
| **> ~$1M vol** | Hard signal — anchor to it |
| **~$50k–$1M** | Usable — corroborate |
| **< ~$50k vol** | Soft/noise — flag, never anchor |

State the volume next to every number you quote. A $5k-volume leg is one trader, not "the market."

## Traps (each one bit a real pull)

| Trap | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Slug-guessing** | `cpi-june-2026` → 404 | Use `public-search`; real slug was `may-inflation-us-annual` |
| **Frozen / settled** | `endDate` already passed; price stuck at 0.99/0.01 | It's a final snapshot, NOT live-tradeable — say so |
| **Thin leg** | <$50k vol, wide bid/ask | Soft signal only; flag it |
| **Non-monotonic ladder** | P(>8%) > P(>5%) — internally impossible | Mispriced illiquid leg; discard that leg, not the market |
| **Multi-outcome doesn't sum to 1** | brackets sum to 1.05 | Normalize, or report raw + note the vig |
| **Stale snapshot** | quoting yesterday's odds | Timestamp the pull (UTC); odds drift, re-pull near events |

## Output (when feeding a forecast)

Per outcome: **implied P + venue + volume + pull-timestamp**, e.g.
`P(FOMC hold, Jun) = 99.1% (Polymarket, $76M vol, pulled 2026-06-10 09:13 UTC)`.
Cross-venue: if Polymarket and Kalshi/FedWatch disagree, report the spread — don't average silently.

## Common mistakes

- Quoting a number with **no volume** beside it → can't tell signal from one-trader noise.
- Browsing `/markets` list to "find" a market → junk; use `public-search`.
- Treating a **settled** market as a live forecast.
- Inventing odds when **no market exists** → say "no tradeable market," fall back to economist consensus.

> Educational, not advice. Odds drift — timestamp every pull and re-fetch before a dated catalyst.
