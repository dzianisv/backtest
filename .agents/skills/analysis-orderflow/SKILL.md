# Analyst: Order Flow & Market Microstructure Lens

Apply this lens to read **who is actually buying and selling at the margin** — not where price has been,
but what the order book, open interest, liquidation clusters, and CVD are *forcing* it to do next.
This is the **microstructure layer** beneath the on-chain and liquidity lenses; it answers short-horizon
questions the valuation lens cannot. Depends on **[[analyst-smartmoney-positioning]]** for live Coinglass data.
Educational, not advice; a lens, not gospel.

## The unifying worldview

Price is the result of **order flow imbalances**. Every candle is a negotiation between resting bids/asks
and aggressive market orders. The market structure lens reads *who is doing what* at the margin: large
passive bids create support (they absorb selling); large asks create resistance (they absorb buying).

**Open interest accumulation with price shows conviction**; OI drop with a price move exposes it as
liquidation-driven — mechanically forced, therefore less reliable and often reversing once the clusters
are swept. **Liquidation clusters are visible gravity wells** — price is attracted to them before reversing,
because the exchange needs to fill stop-market orders sitting at those levels. The **CVD (cumulative volume
delta)** strips the candle narrative away and tells you whether aggressive buyers or sellers are actually
behind the move. **CME gaps fill with ~80% frequency** and act as magnetic pull targets regardless of trend.

The honest limit of this lens: microstructure signals operate on hours-to-days timescales; they are
*flow-and-mechanics reads*, not thesis vehicles. They cannot override a dominant liquidity or valuation
regime — they route *within* it. A liquidation hunt does not reverse a bear market; it produces a bounce inside one.

## Core mental models (the load-bearing ones)

1. **CVD divergence.** Price rising + CVD falling = sellers absorbing the move (supply overwhelming
   aggressive buyers) → **bearish**. Price falling + CVD rising = buyers absorbing the selling (demand
   floor forming under price) → potential **reversal signal**. CVD confirming the price direction =
   trend continuation. CVD is the truth strip underneath the candle's narrative.

2. **OI + price regime.** Rising price + rising OI = new longs entering (trend continuation, real demand).
   Rising price + falling OI = short squeeze (mechanical, less reliable; often reverses once shorts are
   exhausted). Falling price + rising OI = new shorts entering (trend continuation bearish). Falling price
   + falling OI = long liquidation cascade (mechanically driven; watch for reversal after clusters swept).

3. **Liquidation clusters (Coinglass heatmap).** Dense clusters of stop-loss / liquidation orders above
   or below spot are **price magnets**. Price tends to sweep them — triggering cascades — then reverse once
   the mechanical fuel is spent. Clusters on both sides = chop / indecision. One-sided cluster above with
   few below = hunt-upward pattern (and vice versa).

4. **Bid/ask depth imbalance.** Large resting bids (passive buy walls) = support levels; large asks
   (passive sell walls) = resistance levels. Watch for **spoofing**: orders that vanish when price
   approaches — not real support/resistance. Whale order blocks that have been tested and held multiple
   times are more reliable than TA trend lines.

5. **Spot vs perp premium (basis).** Spot price trading at a *premium* over perp = real spot buying
   pressure driving the move (reliable). Perp price at a *premium* over spot = leveraged speculation in
   futures without spot conviction (less reliable, often a setup for a funding-driven flush). Also cross-check
   funding rate: persistently positive = crowded longs, setup for long squeeze.

6. **CME gap.** Unfilled gaps in CME BTC futures (formed over the weekend when crypto trades but CME is
   closed) act as fill targets with ~80% frequency. Gap up → fill often comes on the next open or within
   days. Gap down → price tends to rally back to fill. CME gap + liquidation cluster at the same level =
   high-conviction gravity zone.

7. **Whale order blocks.** Large limit orders that have been tested and held define key S/R levels more
   reliably than TA lines because they represent *actual capital committed*. Levels where visible liquidity
   was absorbed without being broken are where institutions have shown their hand.

## How to apply the lens (decision procedure)

1. **Fetch funding rate + OI via [[analyst-smartmoney-positioning]]** (Coinglass). Classify the OI regime
   (see mental model 2). Note whether funding is neutral, persistently positive (crowded longs), or
   negative (crowded shorts).

2. **Identify liquidation heatmap clusters** via WebFetch `coinglass.com/LiquidationMap`. Locate the
   nearest dense cluster above spot and below spot. Note which side has *more* fuel — that is the likely
   near-term target for a mechanical sweep.

3. **Check for CME gaps** via WebFetch (CME BTC futures chart, weekend open). Note gap level, direction
   (gap up or gap down), and distance from current spot. Mark as *open* or *filled*.

4. **Read spot vs perp premium** (Binance spot BTC price vs the perp contract). Is real spot or
   leveraged futures driving the move? Cross-confirm with funding rate.

5. **State the dominant flow** as one of:
   - **AGGRESSIVE BUYERS** — CVD rising with price, spot premium, OI expanding.
   - **AGGRESSIVE SELLERS** — CVD falling with price, perp premium flushing, OI expanding.
   - **BALANCED** — CVD flat, depth symmetric, no strong bias.
   - **LIQUIDATION-DRIVEN** — OI falling with price move, sweep of known cluster underway; mechanically
     forced, not conviction.

6. **Identify nearest gravity levels**: top liquidation cluster target, bottom liquidation cluster target,
   open CME gap target. These are the levels price is mechanically attracted to next.

7. **State the microstructure posture** as one of:
   - **BULLISH STRUCTURE** — CVD confirming, spot premium, OI rising with price, downside clusters swept.
   - **NEUTRAL** — mixed signals, balanced depth, no dominant flow.
   - **BEARISH STRUCTURE** — CVD diverging, perp premium, OI rising while price fades, upside clusters
     untouched.
   Plus the **key invalidation**: the level or signal change that flips the read.

## Routing table

| Question is about… | Load |
|---|---|
| Live funding rate, OI, options gamma/skew, perpetual premium | `[[analyst-smartmoney-positioning]]` |
| Liquidation heatmap, where the stop clusters are | WebFetch `coinglass.com/LiquidationMap` |
| CME gap level and fill status | WebFetch CME BTC futures chart |
| On-chain valuation zone, MVRV-Z, realized price, NUPL | `research-onchain` → `references/02-onchain-valuation.md` |
| Global liquidity, the macro tide governing all of this | `research-onchain` → `references/01-global-liquidity-and-btc.md` |
| Sentiment, Fear & Greed, cycle phase | `research-onchain` → `references/03-sentiment-and-market-cycle.md` |
| Systematic sizing, vol-target, position sizing | `analyst-systematic-trading` |

## Output contract

Every microstructure read delivers:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| **Dominant flow** | AGGRESSIVE BUYERS / AGGRESSIVE SELLERS / BALANCED / LIQUIDATION-DRIVEN |
| **OI regime** | Which of the 4 OI+price regimes applies; funding rate bias |
| **Nearest gravity levels** | Top liquidation cluster (price, est. size), bottom cluster, open CME gap |
| **CME gap status** | OPEN (level + direction) or FILLED |
| **Microstructure posture** | BULLISH STRUCTURE / NEUTRAL / BEARISH STRUCTURE + key invalidation level |

No buy/sell call — structure and mechanics only. This lens does not override the liquidity governor
(`research-onchain`); it routes *within* the macro regime.

## Done when

The analysis (1) classifies the **OI regime** (trend continuation vs liquidation-driven), (2) identifies
the **dominant CVD flow** (aggressive buyers/sellers/balanced), (3) maps the **nearest liquidation cluster
gravity wells** above and below spot, (4) states **CME gap status** (open or filled, level), (5) reads
**spot vs perp premium** and funding rate bias, (6) outputs a clean **microstructure posture**
(BULLISH / NEUTRAL / BEARISH STRUCTURE) with a specific invalidation level, and (7) explicitly scopes the
read as a short-horizon mechanics lens, not a thesis vehicle — the liquidity governor and on-chain zone
remain the governing frame.
